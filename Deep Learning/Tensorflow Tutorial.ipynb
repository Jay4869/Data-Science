    "## What is a Tensor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, a Tensor is a multi-dimensional data container for modern machine learning. Similar to NumPy ndarray objects, tf.Tensor objects have a data type and a shape. The main difference is that tf.Tensors, additionally, can reside in accelerator memory (like a GPU). TensorFlow offers a rich library of operations (tf.add, tf.matmul, tf.linalg.inv etc.) that consume and produce tf.Tensors.\n",

    "## Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A **computational graph** is a series of TensorFlow operations arranged into a graph. The graph is composed of two types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operations: The nodes of the graph. Operations describe calculations that consume and produce tensors.\n",
    "- Tensors: The edges in the graph. These represent the values that will flow through the graph. Most TensorFlow functions return `tf.Tensors`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Eager Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "The eager execution is the default operating mode of Tensorflow 2.0. So far we have actually been doing everything in eager execution. TensorFlow's eager execution is an imperative programming environment that evaluates operations immediately, without building graphs: operations return concrete values instead of constructing a computational graph to run later. This makes it easy to get started with TensorFlow and debug models, and it reduces boilerplate as well. That being said, in contrary to the eager execution, there is another mode of operation called the graph mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the eager execution mode is easier to code (like plain Python syntax), the graph mode still holds benefits in being portable and highly-performanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not dive deeper into the graph mode in this turorial. If you are interested and wanted to know how to convert to graphical execution in Tensorflow 2.0 via functions, you may refer to [this](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20180918-functions-not-sessions-20.md)"
