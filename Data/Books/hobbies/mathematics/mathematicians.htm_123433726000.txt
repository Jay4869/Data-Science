700 Mathematicians conduct research to develop and understand mathematical principles. They also analyze data and apply mathematical techniques to help solve real-world problems. Mathematicians work in the federal government and in private science and engineering research companies. They may work on teams with engineers, scientists, and other professionals. Mathematicians typically need at least a master’s degree in mathematics. However, some positions are available for those with a bachelor’s degree. The median annual wage for mathematicians was $105,810 in May 2016. Employment of mathematicians is projected to grow 21 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. Businesses will need mathematicians to analyze the increasing volume of digital and electronic data.

What Mathematicians Do Mathematicians conduct research to develop and understand mathematical principles. They also analyze data and apply mathematical techniques to help solve real-world problems. Duties Mathematicians typically do the following: Develop new mathematical rules, theories, and concepts in areas such as algebra and geometry Use mathematical formulas and models to prove or disprove theories Apply mathematical theories and techniques to solve practical problems in business, engineering, the sciences, and other fields Develop mathematical or statistical models to analyze data Interpret data and report conclusions drawn from their analyses Use data analysis to support and improve business decisions Read professional journals, talk with other mathematicians, and attend professional conferences to maintain their knowledge of current trends Despite the differences between applied and theoretical mathematics, these areas frequently overlap. Many mathematicians, particularly those in government or private industry, will use both applied and theoretical knowledge in their job duties.
Work Environment Mathematicians held about 3,500 jobs in 2014. The largest employers of mathematicians were as follows: Federal government 30% Scientific research and development services 16 Colleges, universities, and professional schools; state, local, and private 13 Finance and insurance 7 Manufacturing 5 Mathematicians typically work in offices. They also may work on teams with engineers, scientists, and other occupations. Work Schedules Most mathematicians work full time. Deadlines and last-minute requests for data or analysis may require overtime. In addition, mathematicians may have to travel to attend seminars and conferences. How to Become a Mathematician Mathematicians typically need at least a master’s degree in mathematics. However, some positions are available for those with a bachelor’s degree. Education In private industry, mathematicians typically need an advanced degree, either a master’s degree or a doctorate. For jobs with the federal government, candidates need at least a bachelor’s degree in mathematics or significant coursework in mathematics. Most colleges and universities offer a bachelor’s degree in mathematics. Courses usually include calculus, differential equations, and linear and abstract algebra. Many colleges and universities advise or require mathematics students to take courses in a related field, such as computer science, engineering, physics, or statistics. Because mathematicians often work with data analysis software, computer programming courses may be particularly beneficial for students. Students who are interested in becoming mathematicians should take as many math courses as possible in high school. Important Qualities

Employment of mathematicians is projected to grow 21 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. However, because it is a small occupation, the fast growth will result in only about 700 new jobs over the 10-year period. The amount of digitally stored data will increase over the next decade as more people and companies conduct business online and use social media, smartphones, and other mobile devices. As a result, businesses will increasingly need mathematicians to analyze the large amount of information and data collected. Analyses will help companies improve their business processes, design and develop new products, and even advertise products to potential customers. Mathematicians also will be needed to help information security analysts create data-security systems to protect confidential information of individuals and businesses. Job Prospects Because the occupation is small and there are relatively few mathematician positions, strong competition for jobs is expected. Despite the strong competition for formal mathematician positions, many candidates with a background in advanced mathematical techniques and modeling will find good job opportunities in other, closely related fields. Those with a graduate degree in mathematics, very strong quantitative and data analysis skills, and a background in a related discipline, such as business, computer science, or statistics, should have the best job prospects. Computer programming skills also are important to many employers.
