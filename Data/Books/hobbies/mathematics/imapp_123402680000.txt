IMAPP - Institute for Mathematics, Astrophysics and Particle Physics (UK)
Institute for Mathematics, Astrophysics and Particle Physics Contact Nederlands Search Home Vacancies This department focuses on three interdisciplinary themes, Mathematical Physics, Algebra & Topology and Applied Stochastics. Researchers in this department focus on observational and theoretical research in the area of astronomy. Our experimentalists carry out and analyze experiments in elementary particle physics at the smallest distance and the highest mass scales attainable. Our theorists explore matter and gravity beyond the standard model, and investigate the quantum nature of spacetime at the very shortest scale. The overarching research theme is the origin and evolution of the universe and its underlying mathematical structures. The Institute is also actively engaged in outreach.
