René Descartes once stated that "Mathematics is a more powerful instrument of knowledge than any other that has been bequeathed to us by human agency.” Many scientific laws are nowadays phrased in the language of modern mathematics. Natural phenomena, from weather patterns to the spread of a disease and the evolution of the universe are modeled and analyzed mathematically. Mathematics is used in all modern technological and scientific endeavors, from determining the optimal shape of aircraft wings to Internet search and improving transportation efficiency. Mathematical objects are studied in relation to their empirical origin, or in their own right, in pure math. Home People Search form
