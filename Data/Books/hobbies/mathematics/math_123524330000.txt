Caltech's mathematics program brings together faculty, researchers, and students who have a breadth of interests and expertise in the use and analysis of numbers, and who are interested in collaborating with colleagues across fields to solve some of the most complicated problems of our time. Members of the mathematics faculty conduct research at the intersection of fields ranging from mathematical physics to geometry and topology. They are renowned for their insights in the areas of algebra and mathematical logic; have won top honors for their work in analysis, number theory, and geometry; and have authored texts about mathematical analysis that are considered foundational to the field.
