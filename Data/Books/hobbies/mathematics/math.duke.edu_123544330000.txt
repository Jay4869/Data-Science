about New Number Systems Seek Their Lost Primes: Prof. Lillian Pierce is featured in Quanta magazine Research Ranked in the top 20 math graduate programs by U.S. News & World Report, our faculty conduct more than $3.7 million in research each year for industry, the Department of Defense, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health. Our faculty of 35 includes three National Academy of Science members and two National Academy of Engineering members.  The Department supports more than 50 graduate students. Read more about our research Read more about our research Undergraduate Program As a field of study, mathematics is unique. Known as “The Queen of the Sciences,” it is the purest form of quantitative analytical reasoning and thus has applications to almost every other science. In fact, many sciences rely so heavily on mathematics that their most important questions are, fundamentally, math problems.

Gergen Memorial Lectures One to two times a year, the Math Department sponsors lectures named in honor of Professor John J. Gergen (1903-1967), former chairman of the department. These lecture feature the prominent mathematicians of our time.

Wednesday, September 27 - 3:15 pm We show that the distributions occurring in the geometric and spectral side of the twisted Arthur-Selberg trace formula extend to non-compactly supported test functions. The geometric assertion... Math in Our Society Did You Know? Mathematical sciences are an important part of modern day technological innovation and development. Did you know that math drives the "knowledge economy," including internet startups, biotech, film production, computer games and individualized medicine? Mathematical sciences help us to understand the spread of flu, earthquakes and avalanches, political upheavals and national economic fluctuations, and much more. Read more about Math & Society Read more about Math & Society Why Study Math? Suppose you love mathematics, but ultimately see yourself pursuing a career as a doctor, lawyer, or in business. You should be aware that professional graduate schools in medicine, law, and business think mathematics is a great major because it develops analytical skills and the ability to work in a problem-solving environment. Their entrance tests support this bias, so the more math you know the better you will do on their exams. Read more about the Math Major Read more about the Math Major About Duke Mathematics The Duke Mathematics Department currently comprises 30 tenured and tenure track faculty, 5 teaching faculty, 27 postdocs, and 53 graduate students. We have about 98 undergraduate mathematics majors and 41 minors. The number of mathematics majors who graduated in 2014-15 was 48; 28 mathematics minors also graduated. The research interests of the department span significant areas of pure and applied mathematics. Each year the department sponsors the Gergen Lectures, given by distinguished speakers in the field.
