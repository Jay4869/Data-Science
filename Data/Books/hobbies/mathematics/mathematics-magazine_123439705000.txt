We invite readers to submit original problems that will appeal to students and teachers of advanced undergraduate mathematics. Problem proposals must be accompanied by solutions and any bibliographical information that will assist in their review. A problem submitted as a Quickie should have an unexpected, succinct solution. Submitted problems should not be under consideration for publication elsewhere. . More detailed instructions are available there. We hope that this online system will help streamline our editorial team's workflow while still proving accessible and convenient to longtime readers and contributors. We encourage submissions in PDF format, ideally accompanied by
, Problems Editor, Department of Mathematics, The University of Texas at San Antonio, 1
circle, San Antonio, TX 78249. Please not that physical manuscripts are not the preferred method of submission and correspondents are encouraged to submit their manuscripts electronically if possible. If necessary, prepare Secondary Files for submission. Secondary Files are typically those used to create the Primary File, including TeX/LaTeX source files (plus possibly a BBL bibliography file) and figures in EPS/PDF/JPG/PNG/GIF/TIFF format. Other Secondary File formats include DOC/DOCX, RTF, ODT, WPD/WPF and TXT, to the extent that they are needed to create the Primary File. (Note: While the web form will not enforce submission of Secondary Files, authors are strongly encouraged to provide all files needed to prepare their contribution for publication. Subsequent delay or failure to provide secondary source files upon request from the editors may result in rejection.) Follow the instructions to fill the web form and upload your Primary File and applicable Secondary Files. Click the Submit button at the bottom of the page to send us your contribution and receive a confirmation message by e-mail.
