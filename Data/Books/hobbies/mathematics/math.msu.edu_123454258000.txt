The 2018 Phillips Lecture will be given March 15-19, 2018 by Professor Alex Lubotzky, the Maurice and Claire Weil chair in mathematics at the Einstein Institute of the Hebrew University. We will discuss the application process for NSF Graduate Research Fellowships.
All graduate students who are US Citizens or permanent residents and in their first two years of graduate study are encouraged to attend.
Panelists will include Ignacio Uriarte-Tuero, Effie Kalfagianni, and Jun Kitagawa.
Panel will be in C304 Wells Hall @ 4:10-5:00pm, September 21. Spotlight Sasha Volberg has been named a 2017-18 Simons Fellow in Mathematics as recognition for his work on Harmonic measures, singular integrals, and geometric measure theory. These highly competitive awards recognize excellence in the mathematical and physical sciences. Professor George Pappas has been invited to address the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians in Rio next August. This great honor recognizes his distinguished work in arithmetic algebraic geometry. This award recognizes Pavel's development of an innovative hybrid curriculum for High School students in the Detroit area. Supported by the Bosch Foundation, the curriculum aids underprepared students who wish to engage in a STEM degree program in college.
Thomas Grubb has won a prestigious Goldwater Scholarship
for his work with Prof. Bruce Sagan on combinatorial pattern avoidance
in set partitions and restricted growth functions. There are 250 Goldwater Scholarships
awarded annually to sophomores and juniors across mathematics and science in the US. In addition, Thomas Grubb was also named one of the CNS Dean's research Scholars.
Jenna Jerwers and Taylor Joseph were recently awarded the Outstanding Senior awards, which are presented to graduating seniors who have demonstrated exemplary academic and extracurricular successes, and a strong sense of leadership, commitment and dedication to MSU.
These prizes are awarded annually by the Michigan State University's Senior Class Council. Taylor Joseph, a mathematics major, has also been awarded the Leroy Augenstein Memorial Scholarship from the College of Natural Science.
