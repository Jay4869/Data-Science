Alander Mountain | Hike the Hudson Valley
Hike the Hudson Valley Hike the Hudson Valley Main menu Home The Hikes Store FAQ Leave No Trace Alander Mountain Super-cool Google Earth flyover of hike route:   Google Terrain Map of hike route: The summit of Alander Mountain is unique for this area in that there’s no one place you can point to and say, “This is the best spot to take in the view.”  The grass, rocks and low bushes along the trail at the summit allow you to stop wherever you’d like, grab a seat and create your own personal money spot. For all the beauty you’ll find here, you won’t be bothered by crowds, unless perhaps you’re competing for a spot in the cabin near the summit.  Actually, that’s been empty both times I’ve been up here, so maybe crowds aren’t an issue there, either. On the sunny spring day when I was here last, there were a few people lazing about near the summit, but not nearly as many as there should have been.  This is a gorgeous hike that should be high on your to-do list if you’re willing to burn a few (thousand) calories to earn some awesome views.     1.  From the parking area, head downhill along the road for a couple hundred yards, back to the trailhead on your right.  Careful on the side of the road – if I’m not mistaken, that is one of the biggest fields of poison ivy I’ve ever seen (this is the only spot I noticed any poison ivy along the hike). 2.  From the trailhead, which is clearly marked with several signs on a tree facing the road, hop on the blue-blazed Alander Brook Trail.  Only 2.5 miles from here to the junction with Alander Mountain Trail at the summit?  Piece of cake!  Strenuous, strenuous cake. 3.  For the first mile or so, the trail is pretty flat.  Enjoy it while you can.  In just a couple of minutes, after taking in the nice view across the field to your left, you’ll come to the junction with the Robert Brook Trail, which is marked by a tree that is eating the sign. Turn left here to stay on the Alander Brook Trail.  This is the beginning of the loop – you’ll come back down via the Robert Brook Trail later, when you’re much more tired and sweaty. 4.  In 10-15 minutes, you’ll cross over a culvert (which is what you call those big honking metal pipes, according to the Internet) that directs Alander Brook under the trail.  Directly after this culvert, make a hard right to stay on the Blue Trail.  If you went straight/left here, which looks logical, you’d end up on a Spur Trail to Nowhere, so try not to do that.  (The picture on the left was taken after I’d already crossed the culvert, so that’s the view looking back.) UPDATE 11/6/2016 6.  Shortly after the culvert, the trail reminds you that you are, indeed, climbing a mountain.  The next junction to look for is with the white-blazed South Taconic Trail. It took us 30 minutes to get to that junction from the culvert, including stops to take pictures of salamanders. 7.  When you arrive at the South Taconic Trail, which joins you from the left (careful you don’t stroll past it!), you’ll have climbed about 700 feet from the parking area.  You might want to take a breather at this junction, because the South Taconic Trail isn’t going to take it any easier on you. After you’ve caught your breath, take a left to head uphill on the South Taconic Trail.  You’ll take a few steps up the bank, then curve right with the trail at the tree with the “South Taconic Trail” sign on it. 8.  You have about 500 vertical feet to climb until you’ll pop out into some awesome views.  Just keep trudging up the South Taconic Trail and all your hard work will be rewarded soon.  From the Alander Brook/South Taconic trail junction, it took me about 25 minutes to get to the views, slogging slowly along, wondering how my two-year-old could possibly weigh 300 pounds. 9.  And all of a sudden, there they are.  Those views. 10.  Keep making your way up the trail, stopping often to look at the view behind you.  There’s no one place along this several-hundred-yard length of trail that is the “best” place to take in the view.  If you see a spot that looks good for a picnic or break, by all means, plunk down and gaze into the distance for a while.   11.  On your left, after some more steep climbing, you might notice a sign that tells you you’ve come .8 miles (that’s all?) from the Alander Brook Trail.  Only 1,000 more feet to go until the next trail junction. UPDATE September 2016 13.  Optional step: Turn left to head north on the South Taconic Trail and see some different views.  This will add about 20 minutes of hiking to your day, and it will be up-and-back, returning you to this spot.  If you want to see them, turn left and head through the thick underbrush for a few hundred yards, stopping when you get to a small, rocky and grassy clearing.  The views here aren’t earth-shattering compared to what you’ve just seen, but they’d be a destination on any other mountain.  After you’ve taken them in, return to the junction with the sign sticking out of the rock cairn.   If you’re running low on energy, you shouldn’t feel like you’re missing out on too much if you skip this step.  I skipped it the last time I was here.  The 5.4-mile length for this hike does NOT include this optional step. 14.  From the junction with the rock cairn, facing the sign as if you’ve just arrived from Step 12 above (whether you did the optional step or not), turn right to head toward the “MASS. PARK HQ”.  Goodbye for now, South Taconic Trail!  See you again soon. 15.  In just a moment, you’ll see a cabin through the trees.  Head down the bank to pay it a visit.  From what I can tell, this place is first-come, first-served, and free.  Since there’s no camping allowed up here otherwise, the wooden bunks in this cabin look like the only option for sleeping on Alander Mountain. 16.  From the front door of the cabin, look back uphill, the way you just came down.  Straight ahead, you’ll see a sign directing you to the right for the Alander Mt. Trail, Alander Mt. Summit and South Taconic Trail.  You could retrace your steps to return to your car back this way if you’d like, but I like a good loop, and the way we’ll take down also has some nice views (it’s about the same distance either way). Walk up to that sign and turn left, into the Great Unknown.  Or at least the Great Unmentioned on That Sign, since it doesn’t say what happens when you go left. **UPDATE June 2016** A friend of mine got lost at this spot, so I’d like to make sure we’re absolutely crystal clear on the directions here.  Face the front door of the cabin.  Now turn RIGHT, and head back the way you came, very briefly.  In just a moment, you should the see sign pictured just above, with three arrows pointing right.  At this sign, turn LEFT.  (If you were to make a left turn while facing the front door of the cabin, you’d end up descending Mt. Alander on the wrong side, coming, several miles later, to the Mt. Washington St. Forest HQ in Massachusetts, which is what my friend did.  Her group found a nice hiker to drive them back to their car at the other trailhead, a twenty-minute drive, which was very fortunate and cool of that hiker.  But let’s do our best to have you avoid hitchhiking today, shall we?)
17.  “Dude, seriously?” you might be asking yourself right about now, as the single-track, blue-blazed trail makes its way through a dense mountain laurel thicket.  I promise, the going gets much easier in just a few minutes.  You’re now on the Alander Loop Trail, preparing to make a well-deserved descent. 18.  About five minutes after turning onto the Alander Loop Trail, you’ll come to a small clearing with limited views.  If you haven’t already stopped for lunch or a snack, this is probably your best bet for the rest of the hike, even though you can’t see the views when you’re sitting. 19.  Keep heading down the blue-blazed Alander Loop Trail.  Just when you thought you were done with views for the day, you get some more. 20.  You’ll keep losing altitude for a solid half-hour after that small clearing with limited views, then the Alander Loop Trail dead-ends into the white-blazed South Taconic Trail.  Turn left to go gently uphill along the South Taconic Trail.  Does the South Taconic Trail ever go downhill? 21.  The trickiest junction of the entire hike is coming up in about 10-15 minutes.  It’s a right turn onto the red-blazed Robert Brook Trail.  Keep a sharp eye out for it – if you weren’t paying attention, it’d be easy to stroll right past it.  If you looking for it, though, you shouldn’t have a problem – there are plenty of blazes. When you see those dark red blazes, turn right onto the Robert Brook Trail.  If you miss the turn, enjoy the summit of Brace Mountain in about two miles or so!  No, but seriously, don’t miss the turn. 22.  Thankfully, you’re headed downhill again.  About five minutes after you turn onto the Robert Brook Trail, you’ll pass a concrete NY/MA state line marker. 23.  In another five minutes, you’ll pass another one, for some reason.  We like our state borders clearly marked, indeed we do. Directly after that second marker, be sure to take a right to stay on the Robert Brook Trail.  I’m not sure where that trail coming in from the left goes, but it’s definitely not to your car. 24.  Keep steadily descending, giving away all that altitude you worked so hard to earn.  It took us 40 minutes from the start of the Robert Brook Trail to reach the eponymous Robert Brook.  Once you cross that brook, you’re very close to the finish line. 25.  Less than ten minutes after crossing the stream (probably much less – my son wanted out of the bag, so he walked the rest of the way to the car from here, throwing off my time estimates a bit), you’ll arrive back at the junction with the sign-eating tree.  Hooray! 26.  Take a left to head back down the short trail to the road. 27.  At the road, go left to return to your car.  Watch for traffic!  And wait to collapse until you’re past all the poison ivy.  Phew!  You made it.  I hope you have something delicious for dinner tonight.  Those calories aren’t going to replace themselves.         Was this trail guide useful to you?  Please leave a comment!

<p> Alander Mountain SWJ said: If you were to do this hike in reverse (counter clockwise): I
noticed that there’s a sign on the southern end of the blue, Alander Loop, trail where it ‘dead ends’ in step 20, saying that the trail is closed and advising to ascend Alander Mtn using the South Taconic Trail.
No explanation as to why.
Sorry, I didn’t think to snap a photo.
I don’t know if there’s a similar sign up at the northern end of the trail. 0 ↓ Kelly said: I noticed that too.
Did the hike today and it was awesome!
I saw that sign on the way down, but there was not one at the top.
I used NYNJTC map 107 and it helped, particularly around the cabin junction.
Great time but this was definitely a challenging hike for me.
Quite steep up and down, but Ioved it.
Would be amazing in the fall. 0 ↓ Brendan said: Great TR! I’m hoping to head out there next weekend (April 29th). I’m actually hoping to come across some rattlers to photograph; has anyone come across them this early in the season? Just for fun, I’ve included a photo of a copperhead I took last week in Connecticut. 1 ↓ Mike said: Hi Brendan!
I heard from a friend who saw a rattler at Minnewaska about a week ago, so they are apparently out and about in the area.
(The snake didn’t even rattle as he gently nudged it off the trail with a long stick – he took a video of the proceedings, and the snake seemed awfully mellow about the whole thing.)
I’ve never seen a copperhead before, and hope to keep that streak going.
Thanks for the nice pic – hope you had plenty of zoom on that lens, and I hope any rattlers you find have pleasant dispositions! 0 ↓ Cathy said: Hi–I just got back from trying this hike, and had some difficulty at Step 5. We came to a junction with the blue X on the tree, looked at your directions which said to keep going straight, and continued straight on a trail that was a bit overgrown. We hiked for quite a long time, unable to find the South Taconic Trail turnoff.
After awhile, fearful we had screwed up, we headed back the way we had come. At the junction where the tree with the X is, I tried the other trail (which would have been a right turn at the junction not “straight”), and eventually saw a blue blaze on a tree. Eureka! By now it was getting too late to continue, but I assume this is the correct way? I would suggest changing the directions to indicate that you bear right at the intersection with the Blue X. We have enjoyed using your maps and love the photos. Keep it up! 0 ↓ Mike said: Cathy, I’m so sorry to hear this.
Looking back over the directions above, I’m pretty sure things went off the rails on Step 4.
Here’s what the trail guide says: “Directly after this culvert, make a hard right to stay on the Blue Trail.
If you went straight/left here, which looks logical, you’d end up on a Spur Trail to Nowhere, so try not to do that.”
If you thought you were on Step 5 at that point, you would have been looking at these instructions: “You might notice another trail joining from the left, with a big blue X on the tree to tell you not to go that way.
Take that X’s advice and keep heading straight/uphill on the Blue Trail.”
It sounds to me like you probably ended up on the Spur Trail to Nowhere mentioned in Step 4.
Does that sound like the right prognosis?
Is there anything I could change in the text that would have helped to avoid this problem?
Hope you have a better run at it next time, and I hope we can help others to avoid the same fate! 0 ↓ Cathy said: Hi Mike–Actually I did make
the hard right to stay on the blue trail after the culvert. There was a sort of big climb after that and then I arrived at the intersection With the X on the tree.mentioned. At that point, we would have to turn right again to stay on the blue trail (left would turn us toward the tree with the X). This is where we goofed…your directions said keep “straight/uphill” so we went straight. I think the directions would be correct if you said, at the junction, bear right uphill on the blue trail. I plan to try the hike again, so will take some photos to clear up what I mean. Thanks for your response. 0 ↓ Mike said: This is very helpful, Cathy – thank you!
I just updated Step 5 above with a warning to make sure nobody else hits this same problem.
Let me know if that doesn’t do the trick! 0 ↓ na said: How come the red dots on the map don’t say which junction it is?
It’s completely unclear which way you ascended and descended. The map I’m looking at from the Mt Washington SF government site does not even show an “Alander loop trail”… this is utter #$%^ 0 ↓ Mike said: Pleasure to meet you, na!
When I first created this site, the Everytrail.com maps that I’d create from my GPS data would include waypoint labels and animations of the hike route.
For some reason, Everytrail made changes that removed the animations and stripped out the waypoint labels (hence the red pins with no text).
I agree that it’s less than ideal.
For this hike, I just scrapped the Everytrail link and created a new Google map that includes the waypoint labels — try clicking the link in the “GPS Goodies” section above and see if you don’t find it more useful now.
You can also read the (perhaps too copious) text above to figure out which way I tackled this hike. Hope this all helps you to have a nice adventure out there.
Thanks for stopping by! 0 ↓ Unavailable said: Thank you, lol. I became frustrated trying to puzzle together the way went through reading your account and going back and forth with the red dots. Perhaps my reading comprehension is not what it once was, but I was almost sure that you took the other way up and the left turn near the ny/mass border was where you picked up the STC in step 7.
But then I realized the steps didn’t
in anyway correspond to the red dots and I had no idea of which way you went up. In any event great site and interesting accounts. By the way, I know you know this but you were in the heart of timber rattler territory with dens close by when you sat on that rock on the loop trail for a break. But I’m sure you kept a close eye on the kid, what an experience he’s lucky to have had at such a young age.
I have one last question, in your opinion which of these mountains has the best views? I have time to hike maybe two this fall (I don’t live close by) I know this is relative but as far as views would you choose: Alander, Brace, Race, Bear, Frissell, or Everett?
I’m leaning toward Alander and Race, and Bear my third option if I have the time. Are Braces best views toward the Catskills rather than the rest of the Taconics? Maybe Bear should replace Race? What say you my Toddler toting, unafraid of sitting next to rattlesnakes for a break, South Taconic Mountain expert? 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks for the nice follow-up, Unavailable!
I just added a timber rattler warning to my two Alander trail guides, just to make sure everyone knows to step carefully out there.
As for ranking the views in the Taconics, I would recommend Brace (via the South Taconic Trail – listed as Brace Mountain II on this site), then Alander (via either route), then Race (which I did last year and will write up one of these days – beautiful hike, but the view isn’t as good as Brace or Alander).
I haven’t done Bear or Everett, and Frissell doesn’t have much of a view.
Hope that helps! 0 ↓ not applicable said: Thank you that definitely helps with my decision, I have a hard time with those. 1 Sandy said: Did this hike about a week ago–as you put it so succinctly–great views, steep climb! I just want to point out that the sign mentioned in Steps 12-14 (the sign sticking out of the rock cairn) is in bad shape.
When we got there it was in pieces; only 1 piece that was barely hanging on was still attached & it was hanging at an angle with arrows in the wrong direction. It was impossible to use that sign as it was for directions. You wisely tell folks to go right to continue the loop when they get to that junction.
I would just reiterate it here–don’t worry about what the sign says, or which way it appears to be pointing–just go right at that junction.
Btw, met some NYNJ Trail Conference folks on the way down & told them about the sign.
They said they were aware but with so many signs to maintain, don’t know when they’ll get to it. (The pic I posted of the sign is after I picked up a fallen piece & kind of leaned it next to the attached piece) 2 ↓ Mike said: Thank you, Sandy!
I’ve just updated the trail guide at Step 12 with a link down to your comment.
Very much appreciated! 0 ↓ Keerthana said: This is so awesome! I wish I had seen this before doing this hike yesterday. I took the alander trail, went past the south taconic, into the white traill, then switched to blue trail. We reached at the cabin, and continued upwards to the summit. The summit was a big tease as there was a breathtaking view after every big ascent we took however it was not the top so we kept going up and up forever. But got to say, the almost 360 degree view at the summit was worth every bit. On our way back, we had a visitor, a black timber rattle snake (around 1.5 feet) right on the middle of the trail path. It was quite an experience. I definitely plan on going back, to try a different trail to the mount.
Your record of the trails are amazing , it will definitely help me when I go back. Thank you !!! 🙂 2 ↓ Amanda said: Just want to say thank you. I followed this post to a “T” today. I didn’t miss a single turn. Loved the pictures and landmarks! You doing this with a kid made it feel super attainable. Took me 3 hours to do the loop. Stopped at the cabin to have lunch. Great day man. Thanks for helping me have the confidence in the trails. Met 2 Rattlesnakes today on the trails, super cool. 4 ↓ Danit said: Just a quick thank – you . Your instructions were very helpful. 3 ↓ nyebone said: I did this hike yesterday, altho in the opposite direction.I got quite confused near the cabin by the sign pointing to the summit. This is contradictory to the summit location on my NYNJ trail map, hence the confusion. I needed my compass to figure out which direction to continue (south). Perhaps I’m getting a little senile, at age 63 w 50 years hiking experience. Anyhoo… a wonderful hike thanks for posting it on your GREAT website. 1 ↓ John said: 0 ↓ John said: John, you seriously need to listen to my advice about posting after/while you’re imbibing 0 ↓ Ricky said: Thanks for the great guide. I plan on trying this weekend. Is it possible to take the blue trail all the way up? I’m a bit confused by the directions, why do you not turn towards the arrow pointing to the summit? 0 ↓ Mike said: Hope you have a great trip, Ricky!
You COULD finagle a trip to the top using only the Blue Trail, but that would be a different hike than the one outlined above, and I’ve never tried it before.
If you’re referring to Step 16 above, you turn away from the summit because, at that point, you’ve already visited the summit, so you turn left there to continue along the loop.
I hope this is helpful!
Let me know if I didn’t answer your question. 0 ↓ Jay said: Pardon meh, but is there directions to the trailhead parking on this page? 0 ↓ Jay said: delete delete found them sorry on the other page Alander II the directions were at the top 1 ↓ Jay said: oh no they weren’t they were at the bottom. haha good stuff, I should start smoking weed again it makes me more perceptive. 1 ↓ Jay said: Thanks for the detailed directions on your hike reviews, extremely helpful. 1 ↓ MBow said: It poured out so I guess he was sun bathing, he wasn’t aggressive or anything but god was he big! and he was also blocking our path, we ended up having to cut through the brush to get around him. 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks for the heads-up!
Seems like this area, including Brace Mountain, is not in any danger of running out of rattlesnakes anytime soon.
In my experience, bumping into a rattlesnake is one of those things that’s very cool in retrospect.
Glad you didn’t get any better acquainted with him than you did. For the sign issue, please let me know if an update to the guide above could be helpful to help others avoid the same fate.
Thanks for taking time to drop a comment, MBow! 0 ↓ MBow said: It shouldn’t be a major problem for anyone as long they know how to tell North/South/East/West We were just so confused when we looked at the sign and south was north and north was south. We should have just listened to instinct really but we followed the sign and later realized it was totally turned around. But yea, the rattlesnake was beautiful for sure. Definitely a bit alarming but a fun time, I want to go back and try and get Brace Mountain done by the end of the fall. 1 ↓ Jacquelyn Pierce said: Thanks so much for the detailed guide! Without you I would of been very lost. 🙂 0 ↓ Jim Hall said: Mike, Hi, first off – thanks for all of the work that you have done on all of the trails.
I have hiked more than five this summer and fall – all of your trail advise has been very helpful.
I am thinking of hiking Alander Mt. this weekend and would like your opinion on the possible conditions.
Do you know if anyone has tried this late in the year.
Any advise would be appreciated.
thanks, Jim 1 ↓ Mike said: Hi Jim, Glad to hear the site has been useful for you!
I’ve never tried it this late in the year, and especially after the snowfall we got last night, along with fallen leaves, I’d expect the trail conditions to be pretty dicey and more difficult to follow.
If you have experience with this kind of thing, it’d be beautiful up there, but my blanket recommendation would be that it might be better to wait until spring, or at least until we have a good long dry/warm(ish) stretch.
Good luck if you give it a go! 0 ↓ Jim Hall said: Mike, Thanks for information.
I think I might try Brace Mt.
I am hopeful that you did not get that much snow ‘up north’ – I live in Westchester – and that today’s temps melt what ever you did get.
I don’t plan on pushing it if the conditions look that bad.
I just need to get out and have done all of the difficult hikes nearer to me.
I will let you if I make it and what the conditions were like.
Thanks again for your hard work on this website.
I love it and have recommended to many friends. Jim 0 ↓ Clayton H. said: 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks, Clayton!
I ran into a rattler on nearby Brace Mountain, and I don’t recall finding the humor in the whole thing until way, way later.
They’re apparently all over the place in the Taconics.
Step carefully out there, everyone! 0 ↓ Jay said: I couldn’t believe how much it will cost for the large doses of anti-venom for the timber rattler bite, considering that you need ~20-40 times the dosage amount for other rattlers.
Does anyone have any personal recommendations for a good snake bite kit? I like to hear from people who have actually had to use them, kind of hard to find those types of reviews, which I guess is good in a sense. 0 ↓ Chris said: 0 ↓ Mike said: Not sure why I didn’t reply to this comment long ago, but thanks so much for the kind words and useful info, Chris!
Very much appreciated. 0 ↓ Kelsey said: Hi Mike, I’m with a university outdoors club and we want to do some hiking in the area this Saturday, March 1st. Do you know if there is too much snow? Are trails open and would crampons be necessary? Thanks! 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Kelsey!
Your comment prompted me to update this page with a link to the Mt. Washington State Forest HQ homepage – the old page had become a broken link that I’d deleted.
I’ve never done this hike in the winter, and am not sure of the trail conditions at the moment, but would venture a guess that they are fairly gnarly.
Even in warm weather, this is a tough hike.
Please give the park HQ a call and see what advice they have for you there – the number given on their homepage is (413) 528-0330.
Hope that helps – have a great trip, and take lots of pictures! 0 ↓ Tracy said: My friend and I decided to take a hike up there yesterday around 3:15. Not really paying attention to the time or thinking about what time the sun would be setting. Thanks to your very detailed descriptions and spot on times we were able to navigate our way down after the sun had set. Thank you for providing beautiful pictures and a thorough description of what to look for! The hike kicked our butts but was so worth it! Thanks again! 0 ↓ Mike said: So glad you made it down safely!
Hope you have many more great adventures out there, perhaps with slightly less excitement. 0 ↓ Paul Wimmer said: Hi we just hiked the trail today. Your website helped tremendously thank you. We got down following the loop, not sure exactly how but we did. Along the way down we encountered a 3ft timber rattler. Very cool well at least i thought so. I have a question though. At the top we came across a military ammo box. My son and daughter were very intrigued by it. There was definitely something inside of it but we chose not to open it. Just curious if you know anything about it. It was pretty much out in the open. Thanks Paul 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Paul, Hope this is helpful — thanks for taking the time to comment! Mike 0 ↓ Jessica said: 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Jessica!
That’s a good question.
I got that number (1,822′) from my hiking GPS, which records all the ups and downs during the hike.
If you click the first link in the “GPS goodies” section at the top of this page — the one that says “Google Terrain map” — you’ll see an overlay of the elevation profile for this hike, including the little upward jog between mile 3 and 4 that should account for a good percentage of that extra 400 ft (if you’re using a mobile device to click that link, you won’t see the elevation profile – it needs to be a regular laptop/desktop browser). Hope that helps, and I hope you and the scouts have a great trip! 0 ↓ Kelly said: Do you have an address for the parking area at the start of the trail? 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Kelly,
Just the intersection I gave in the “Sorta nearby address for your GPS” section above, which should work for putting into Google Maps or a GPS device, and will get you really close – the “Directions to the trailhead” section gives more details, too.
(There’s a house right across the street, but it seems weird for me to post private addresses to this site, so I generally don’t do it.) Hope that helps!
Let me know if you still can’t find it.
Have fun out there if you check this one out! Mike 0 ↓ Kimberly Kilbride said: On step four, it says that if you go straight, it’s a dead end. Tonight we accidentally missed the turn off and went straight. That way, albeit probably longer, is a gentle carriage way esque trail right to the top of the Alander Trail. Basically, the blue trail is shorter, but if you want to save your knees a bit for the descent, you can head straight and end up there anyway. Either way the hike was amazing, and your trail guide, a usual, was helpful in negotiating it. 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks, Kimberly!
That’s good to know – never tried that way.
And thanks for the kind words.
Very much appreciated.
