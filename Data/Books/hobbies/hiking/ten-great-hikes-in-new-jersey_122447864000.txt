Ten Great Hikes in New Jersey
0 What You Need Hiking boots come in two options: a high top for better ankle support
or low top for comfort. Military boots are also good for hiking, but
are heavy and need to be broken in prior to your adventure. Boots are
also a necessity since snakes and spiders are a common occurrence in the
Northeast, but whichever boot you opt for, just make sure you can tuck
the bottom of your pants into them so that a tick can’t sneak onto your
leg. If wearing a low top boot, grab some duct tape and tape the bottom
of your pants closed around your leg instead. Hazards of Hiking There are a few hazards that come with hiking – mainly wandering off
the trail and becoming lost, injuring your foot or ankle, being bitten
by an animal or dehydration. Above all, stay together while hiking - you
should never hike by yourself. If you do become lost, first of all Do Not Panic. Remain calm and
begin by looking at your compass and map to determine where you may be –
if nothing else, determine which direction is north. Secondly, check to
see if you have cell phone service to call for help. If there is a
clearing near where you are standing, move into the clearing so that
emergency help can locate you easily. Where to Go More from Teaneck Patch Patch Community Guidelines Patch welcomes contributions and comments from our users.
