Breakneck Ridge | Hike the Hudson Valley
Hike the Hudson Valley Hike the Hudson Valley Main menu Home The Hikes Store FAQ Leave No Trace Breakneck Ridge It is extremely difficult, though, and I’d be very hesitant to recommend this hike for small children.  I’ve done most of the hikes in Hike the Hudson Valley with a baby on my back, but I’d never attempt that here.  And I’d only bring a dog that I could carry. I didn’t see any other dogs there that day, but a fellow hiker assured me that she sees dogs here all the time.  There were several spots where my pooch Memphis needed a boost, and I honestly don’t see how a dog would get over some of those spots without being picked up and placed on top of the rocks. The point I’m trying to make: This hike is steep. It is also gorgeous and unforgettable.  If you have a chance to pay a visit to Breakneck Ridge, don’t pass it up.  And if you don’t have a chance, you should probably make one anyway. Trail guide: 2.  Climb up and over the tunnel that runs over Rt 9D, following the White Trail markers. 4.  Enjoy the view toward the river, and try not to think too much about what’s waiting behind you. Oops, you thought about it, didn’t you?  Oh well, might as well start climbing again.  Just keep following those white markers. There are a few spots where you can choose steeper or less steep options, which you’ll see marked with an X pointing left and right. See that guy on the cliff in the picture above?  He was heading down, and when he popped out beside a rock to my left (I was looking right – he surprised me), I realized that the trail was less steep the way he came down.  That guy saved me at least one dog-carry. 5.  Keep climbing, and the flagpole becomes a distant memory. 6.  Take some time to enjoy the next cliff overlook. 7.  Keep climbing, and eventually, this mountain will run out of bluffs to throw at you.  Really, it will.  When it feels like you’re at the top and you can’t see any more bluffs in front of you, you’re probably there.  You’ll have traveled about a mile, though it seems more like ten.  The next three miles on the loop fly by in comparison. At the top, above a couple of nice little pine trees, enjoy the view and munch a granola bar or two, if you packed ‘em. 8.  It wouldn’t be a bad hike to just go straight back down the White Trail from here.  That’s really where the best views are.  Most hikers like a good loop, though, so if that applies to you, let’s keep trekking.  (Also, the rest of the loop doesn’t require any dog-carrying.  The thought of carrying my dog back down some of those White Trail sections again was enough to keep us pressing forward.) 9.  In the small saddle after the last big bluff, ignore the Yellow Trail as it departs to your right.  Keep heading straight on the White Trail. 10.  You’re looking for a turnoff on your left to the Red Trail, after you pass one last small summit and a little marsh on your right (the frogs were going nuts in there when we walked past in late March – I thought we were coming upon a flock of turkeys.  Also, the Internet tells me that I should have said “a rafter of turkeys,” but somehow that seems like the only way to talk about turkeys and be pretentious at the same time.) The turnoff to the Red Trail is very tough to miss.  The only thing it’s lacking is a flashing light, and perhaps some sort of siren.  When you see it, take a left. 11.  Follow the Red Trail (aka the “Breakneck Bypass”) down a much more gradual descent through the woods, with occasional northerly views of Sugarloaf and the river. 12.  After 30-60 minutes, depending on how leisurely you’re strolling, the Red Trail dead-ends into the Wilkinson Memorial Trail, marked in yellow.  Take a left onto the Yellow Trail and keep following it downhill. 13.  The Yellow Trail continues its gradual descent for 15 minutes or so, ending abruptly and dumping you unceremoniously onto Route 9D, which can be a pretty busy road. Normally, I hate road hikes, and don’t consider a loop trail that has a large road section to be much of a loop.  But you can actually see the parking area from the dump-out point, so we’ll let this one slide, especially since it kept us from having to carry our dogs back down the mountain. Take a left onto Route 9D and walk carefully on the well-worn path beside it. 14.  Carefully cross the street once you get back to your car.  Boom!  You did it.  Congratulations on knocking out one of the toughest hikes in the area.  Now find someone to show all your awesome pictures.       Was this trail guide useful to you?  Please leave a comment!

<p> Breakneck Ridge Andrey said: 0 ↓ Josh said: Did this hike today (a Wednesday). While the parking lots filled up, I got there early enough to avoid craziness hiking up and it appeared that most hikers either turned around at the flagpole or returned down the yellow (Undercliff) trail before reaching the summit. The signs at the trailhead don’t lie: this definitely is “NOT a walk in the park”, but it’s not particularly tiring, as the immediate rock scrambles force you to set a slow pace. A little over a mile from trailhead to summit and it’s mostly rock scrambling. I’m a 22 year old in decent shape and the loop took me 3 1/4 hours, including a stop at the flagpole and lunch at the summit; 2 hours of that was the ascent. A few notes I’d like to add: 1 ↓ Mike said: Thanks so much for the helpful updates, Josh!
Glad you had a great day out there.
(And I’ll second the plug for the Avenza Maps app — just used it for the first time on a different hike, and it is really great to know exactly where you are at all times.) 1 ↓ MICHAEL a MOOK said: hi
Normally we do the W-R-Y path and it takes about 2 hours.
If we want to go longer would we then do the W to Blue/white (dont turn at the red and then come back down the yellow)?
How much extra time do you think that will take? 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Michael — I’ve never tried that route, but it looks like a nice option if you’re looking to do a longer hike (W-BW-B-Y(left)).
From the map, it looks to at least double the length of this hike, but the terrain shouldn’t be as gnarly once you’ve gained the initial elevation.
My irresponsible, shot-in-the-dark guesstimate: 6.5 hours total, or 2.5 additional hours onto however long it takes you to do the W-R-Y version.
Let me know how close I got if you give it whirl! 🙂 0 ↓ michael k said: I am planning to tackle this hike this sunday, but looks like it will be raining on friday and saturday.
Anyone know how the conditions would be after 2 days of rain.
Would it be safe enough to attempt? thanks! 4 ↓ Shirley Maloney said: Selling hot dogs at the tunnel is great 0 ↓ DOLLAR BILL said: Yesterday, I rode Metro North to Cold Spring and walked to the Breakneck trail head. Kind of a long hoss but not that bad really. And the views are nice along the way. Once through the tunnel, I took the white trail past the cut off and turned right on the Notch Trail (blue)…then the red trail and to another blue trail (Cornish) and all the way back to Stony Point where I spent a last hour exploring there. This is doable. For people considering taking the train to Cold Spring…you can walk to Breakneck and forgo the cab. I’m a healthy 66 years old and not even sore today. And of course, the views are multiple and spectacular. And there’s even a doozy AFTER the cutoff you’ll miss if you take the short version of the hike. 1 ↓ Mary said: Thanks for description of the trail. My 18 yr. old son wants to take some friends there, so I wanted to check it out. Looks amazing! 0 ↓ Bob Warsak said: 7 ↓ T. Drake said: First, from a local: thank you. Lots of us carry garbage bags as a matter of course, especially on Mondays. It’s depressing.
Worse now is the proliferation of graffiti. Robust discussion locally, but I seriously wish the parks department would step in. 4 ↓ Tony said: Beautiful and challenging hike. Major gripe is heavy crowds, severely eroded breakneck ridge and wilkenson memorial trails. I hiked from breakneck to beacon back in 05 on a holiday weekend and
not seeing that many people along the way. 9D wasn’t lined up with cars when I finished my hike like you see today. 2 ↓ Dave said: Go early and go often…
Hiked Breakneck today for the 2nd time this season and it was absolutely beautiful out. The first time I hiked this trail I was with the LADY! and about 100 other people who decided scrambling up the face of a mountain would be a good idea. While the firt trip up was great, having to wait for others to find their next move, and also having to navigate around people who decided they wanted to stop and look out at the Hudson before even reaching the flagpole, was frustrating at the least. I planned it better this time and got to the trail before 8am. I was one of 6 cars at the trail head when I arrived, and did not see anyone else on the trail till the 2nd lookout. It was absolutely beautiful. The Scramble is difficult. There are parts where it is fairly easy, but then there are parts where you will seriously hurt yourself if you lose footing or are scared to get your hands dirty on some mossy rock. While my first trip here didn’t feel as difficult as today, I think part of that was that I subconsciously followed the people in front of me, and was able to see where they grabbed and stepped.
Since I was alone and there wasn’t hardly any traffic, I was able to take a few moments on a few of the payoffs to just sit down and look out at the hudson river. It was also fun looking across the way at Storm King thinking “a few weeks ago I climbed that mountain and was looking back over here at Breakneck…” The way down wasn’t bad, but it was a bit slippery since there had been some rain last night.
All in all, I ended up seeing 3 people and a dog at one of the most popular hiking spots in the hudson valley, and was able to get in nearly 4 miles and a nice rest on the payoff in 2 and a half hours. When i was walking back to my car, the masses were finally starting to arrive and hit the trailhead. It made me really happy that I got up early rather than sleeping in. 3 ↓ Yuliya Semenova said: Hello guys,
I like to check out the map before I get on the trail. Which state park should I be checking out the map for which includes this trail? Thank you a bunch. 0 ↓ Mike said: Yuliya, Man, keeping the links on this site current is tough, especially when New York State switches its URLs around every year or so, just to keep me on my toes.
I’ve fixed the links above so that you no longer need to know which park to select – the links will take you right to a PDF trail map, just like they used to do.
(See the map link in Step 1 of the trail guide, or in the Related Resources section.) Hope that helps – thanks for the alert! Mike 0 ↓ Richard said: I’d like to go for a day hike from NYC but I’m without a car. Is it possible to come from Grand Central Station to Cold Springs and get a taxi from there to the trail head? Otherwise, is walking from Cold Springs train station to the trailhead the only other option? Thank you! 0 ↓ Matthew said: There is actually a stop at Breakneck Ridge a handful of times per day. Check the MetroNorth schedule to see the times. My buddy and I took the train there, hiked the trail, and ended up in Cold Springs, where we caught the MetroNorth back. 1 ↓ Rick Elezi said: We went here yesterday with my staff thinking we were doing the other one thats 7 rated.
So we werent full prepared.
Had some friends too so we were 13 in total.
One of my friends had a broken foot and had to do the whole thing with a stick.
It was hard but he is happy he did it.
We really enjoyed this hike and want to do it again.
With proper planning of course. 0 ↓ mook said: We love your site.
How much longer does it take to keep going up the white until it runs into the yellow. Another words skip the bypass?
Thanks again 0 ↓ Chase Hostler said: Hey Mike, I noticed you said your friend got to the trailhead from the cold springs station. Is that an easy walk?
I’m looking to do Breakneck this Friday but not sure that the Breakneck station is open that day, and looking for an alternative… 0 ↓ G said: Hi. I walked from the station to the trailhead before. I believe it’s around a 2.8 mile-walk. Easy on the way there but horrible on the way back especially if it’s hot. But overall, it’s fine. Hope this helps! 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks for the info, G!
Chase, as G said, it would not be an easy walk.
Possible, yes, but not easy.
My buddy cheated by having me pick him up, and I drove us to the trailhead.
If Uber isn’t already in Cold Spring (I’m country folk, so I have no idea), seems like a ripe opportunity there.
You could probably make a living shuttling hikers from the Cold Spring station to the area’s various trailheads.
I just checked Google Maps, and G’s estimate looks about right — around 2.5+ miles from the train station to the Breakneck trailhead.
Good luck and enjoy, however you get there! 0 ↓ Chase said: Thanks Guys!
I think I’m going to try and find a cab or uber from the CS station.
Thinking of doing the white ridge trail up and taking the blue notch trail back to either the red to blue or yellow trails back into cold spring for a rewarding beer and burger.
Any suggestions of which of those two trails to take (R or Y)?
Any special sights?
I see ruins on the map..intriguing…. 0 ↓ Chase said: 0 Ceem said: Hi. Thanks again for your wonderful trail guides. Ive been to Storm King, Lake Minnewaska, Anthony’s Nose, Bull Hill, Mt Beacon, Bonticou Crags and Table rocks, Sam’s Point, Little Stony Point, Walkway over the Hudson and Croton Gorge Park all because of your very helpful guides! Ive been to Breakneck as well but i wanted to know, how do i find that old eerie tree? I know its weird but id love to go visit Breakneck Ridge again just to see that tree hehe! 1 ↓ Mike said: That’s quite a list, Ceem!
Awesome!
That’s really great to see – glad the site has been useful for you. As for the tree (I assume we’re talking about this one from the slideshow?), it was photo #512 from that day, and the photo in Step 12 above, showing the turn onto the Wilkinson Memorial Trail, is #514.
Given that I take about one photo every ten seconds out there, I’m guessing that old tree is somewhere very, very close to the turnoff.
(My buddy Rob noticed it – have to give him credit.)
Hope that helps!
You’ll have to share your own pic after you find that tree 🙂 0 ↓ Ceem said: Oh my, I feel terrible about not being specific about it and you had to go thru the slideshow. I actually saw the picture of the tree recently on Hike the Hudson Valley’s Facebook page but i couldn’t find it anymore. I have seen many others post that picture but no directions at all and I feel like I should go there too haha! Anyways, attached is the photo of tree I was talking about. No pressure though. It might not actually be along the trail. Thank you! 0 ↓ Mike said: Oh, of course!
Yes, that tree is on Sugarloaf, right next to Breakneck.
At the junction near the other not-as-cool-spooky-old-tree, instead of turning left to descend on the Yellow (Wilkinson Memorial) Trail, you’d turn right to ascend Sugarloaf.
That old tree is a local landmark – anyone who chooses to visit, please treat it with respect!
(I know you would do this, Ceem, but I did accidentally share a photo of two people sitting in the tree on this site’s Facebook page.
I thought they were branches when I glanced at the otherwise stunning picture on my phone.
When I looked at a bigger screen and realized what was going on in that shot, I deleted it from my Facebook timeline, which is probably why you can’t find it there anymore.
That tree would surely not survive being treated like that for long, and it would be a real loss if that thing came down.)
Hope that helps! 0 ↓ Ceem said: I know. If that tree doesn’t survive, people like me might not have a chance to see it anymore!
And thank you for letting me know where it is! I will visit it next week. Thanks again! 1 tami said: which of those was your favorite? 0 ↓ Dave said: Great site. My wife and I have done Anthony’s Nose, Storm King Mountain, and Bull Hill using this website this spring already.
Also have done the Major Welch trail in Bear Mountain.
How much more difficult is Breakneck than these?
I really want to do this and we’re in great physical shape but don’t want to underestimate.
Thanks! 0 ↓ Mike said: Dave, that’s awesome!
Glad the site has been useful for you.
Breakneck is comparable to the steepest parts of Storm King — I expect you guys won’t have any issues, but I gave this one a 10 out of 10 difficulty rating so people would take it seriously.
Happy adventuring! 0 ↓ Maloy said: 1 ↓ Mike said: Hi, Maloy!
I parked right next to the tunnel – I took a vacation day and did this hike on a weekday, so there were spots available there.
The overflow parking is just a little further north.
Not sure about the other trail you’re mentioning – I’ll have to look for it next time.
Sorry I can’t be more help on this one! 0 ↓ rick said: Last did this hike 25 years ago.
Wife and none of my out of shape BFFs are interested.
Too bad.
Spectacular views, challenging climb and an hour outside NYC.
It is a SCRAMBLE and at times will need all extremities to achieve solid hand/foothold.
You don’t need to do technical climbing for the harder (non-alternate) route but you should be very experienced or at least go with someone who is so you can be leveraged ever upward.
Light gloves are good idea.
Plenty of water (amazing number of folks going up with no fluid replacement).
The cardiovascular challenge will have you sweating at 40 degrees F within 15 minutes so bring lots of easily sheddable layers if you want to be dry on the level
and descending part of the hike.
And the initial descent on the uneven Red bypass trail in late fall covered by leaves can be particularly challenging.
A good collapsible pole would be valuable here.
And above all take your time.
Start early enough…you want to budget comfortably 3hrs for traditional loop white-red-yellow-9D loop unless you want to be the object of ridicule (or worse) by the Cold Spring Fire and Ambulance crew. 0 ↓ cold spring resident said: City hikers – please use common sense when taking a trip up here from Brooklyn to hike. This is an incredibly dangerous and difficult hike. Please bring proper boots, proper gear and a map/compass. We love the visitors, but tire of our FD and amulence corps volunteers having to go out on calls to find lost hikers every weekend. 0 ↓ Justin said: Hey Mike, So, I got in touch with Chase at Xcelerated Adventures for my tour. There was a group of 12 of us and he was an AWESOME guide for this hike. For people who are not seasoned hikers but want to do something challenging like this, I think its super beneficial to do it with a guide. Chase was amazing! I’d highly recommend his company for these tours. 0 ↓ Justin said: Amazing!! Thanks so much!! 0 ↓ Justin said: I want to do the hike with a few friends this weekend. Does anyone know of an individual or company that offers guided tours for Breakneck Ridge? 0 ↓ Mike said: The bottom of the page says that their guided tours of Breakneck are closed until April – seems like unfortunate timing.
Might be worth reaching out to them, anyway.
Hope that helps! 0 ↓ Jeff said: Mike, thanks so much for putting this website together.
It has been extremely informative when planning hikes in and around the Hudson Valley. I am looking at hiking Breakneck Ridge this weekend and we’ll be taking the train from Grand Central.
I was thinking about starting at the Breakneck Ridge train station and ending in Cold Spring to take the train back from there.
In looking at the map, we were thinking of taking the Notch trail after the ruins and then taking the Washburn trail down to Little Stony Point to get some well deserved food in Cold Spring.
Since we won’t have a car, we don’t need to do the loop, so thought about mixing it up.
Have you done this version?
If so, any idea of the distance and time on this trail?
Much appreciated, Mike. Jeff 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Jeff!
I’ve never done that route before, but on the map, it looks doable, assuming you are in really good shape and up for climbing both Breakneck Ridge and Bull Hill.
From the ruins to the Bull Hill parking lot (taking Notch Trail to Washburn Trail), it’s about 3 miles, going straight up and back down the mountain.
A tamer option would be to take the Red Trail (Brook Trail) from the ruins, then down the Blue Trail (Cornish Trail) back to the parking lot, which completely avoids climbing Bull Hill.
The good news is that you’ve got options — you can see how you’re feeling at the ruins and decide whether to tackle Bull Hill or not.
Sounds like a great day either way — hope you enjoy it!
(Update: My original comment misstated the elevation change and total distance — the Notch Trail doesn’t go over the summit of Bull Hill, but it comes pretty close.
The total distance from the ruins to the parking lot would be just over three miles (not four, as I’d originally said) going Brook (Red) Trail -> Notch (Yellow) -> Washburn (White).
Sorry about that!) 0 ↓ Gabe said: Woot, finally made it out to the hike and it was great. A little nerve racking as we never rock scrambled before and we got a little frazzled at the end trying to follow the yellow train connected to Fire Tower lane (beware, a few trail markers are on downed trees and some sections near the small stream can get you lost). Will be making this trip again. On a side note, on the listing of trails, would it be possible to add a list of hikes that can be reached without a car? Will be looking forward to go on more runs. Thank you. Gabe 0 ↓ Mike said: 0 ↓ Gabe said: Gabe 0 ↓ Mary DeWitt said: My husband and I hiked this for the first time yesterday. It is challenging but worth it! The views are fantastic! 0 ↓ Korin G. said: Really hoping its nice tomorrow and I will be going on this trek!
So excited, thank you for all the good reference points!!! 0 ↓ Krista said: Tried this for the first time today. This was probably the hardest trail I’ve done to date, but
you really feel on top of the world once you finally…finally!!!…reach the top. Thank you for noting the nice loop trail. I was very happy to learn I would NOT have to navigate my way back down some of those really sheer rock faces. I would definitely do this again! 0 ↓ pwchao said: We finished this loop today (7/6/2014) and enjoyed it very much. The views and rocks are spectacular. We are 70+ years old and used alternative routes to reach the top. We will go back to hike this loop again soon. 0 ↓ Mike said: That’s fantastic!
Hope I’m still motoring up Breakneck when I’m 70+, too.
Glad to hear you all enjoyed it. 0 ↓ Mara said: I was trying to give you a thumbs up!
Not sure what happened.
Kudos to you!!!!!!! 0 ↓ aaron said: Is the rock climbing described straight up a rock face or over boulders/onto ledges? 0 ↓ leah said: Good news!!! I took him there yesterday and he LOVED it (as did I). I even got him to say he would rather be there than six flags 🙂 your guide was awesome… And yes he managed the whole loop!!!! Was an awesome family hike thanks for this awesome website 0 ↓ Mike said: You just made my day – thank YOU, Leah!
That’s awesome to hear! 0 ↓ leah said: I spent a year in Israel doing some crazy hikes, but always with a guide. I was thinking that it was time to discover my home country and your site seens like an awesome place to start! Breakneck sound amazing from all I’ve read online. I’m just a little apprehensive of the initial hour of rock scrambling that everyone discusses bec I plan On bringing my thirteen year old baby brother. (he is not a bad hiker… He’s done mohonk mountain and loved it) any advice? 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi, Leah!
If he’s done Mohonk, I bet he’ll be just fine at Breakneck.
I saw some very young kids (6 or 7 years old) on my last trek there, and they seemed to be eating it up.
I doubt they did the whole loop, but even the trip to the flagpole and back is rewarding.
Hope you have a great trip and enjoy exploring the area! 0 ↓ Daisy said: Are guides readily available at this site? 0 ↓ Mike said: 0 ↓ tarajean said: I’m a bit scared of heights, but fit and cautious.
Bull Hill wasn’t a problem for me, but walking a treeless outcropping while viewing the river below is going to be problematic!
Thoughts? 0 ↓ Mike said: Heights are kind of part of the package with Breakneck, but the trail doesn’t force you to walk out to any cliff edges if you’d prefer not to.
Hope you enjoy it if you decide to check it out! 0 ↓ Kiran Mahale said: One of my friends suggested the hiking place and I came across ur site/blog. After reading your site I was planning to do alone but both of my kids were crying while I was leaving. So I took both of them for hiking. While driving to the tunnel destination my thinking was if it is difficult as mentioned in couple of sites I would just visit near by view point. But Once I reached the place both girls were ready to roll. Yesterday I did hiking with my 2 girls(7 year, 5 year) and we did 3.5 mile loop(W+R+Y) in 3.5 hours. We started at 2:30 and my the time we reached 1200 ft it was 4:30 but girls were still energetic. The view is so beautiful up there. I could not believe my 5 year old kid did this. Couple of dogs were climbing with their owners and my 5 year old just followed the dogs up hill. Your site helped me to understand where to see red and yellow trails and other alt routes. 1 ↓ Elizabeth said: Hello!
I did the Labyrinth at Mohonk two years ago and loved it. There’s something so much more fun about rock scrambles vs. hiking.
But I missed the Lemon Squeeze due to time constraints and pure inability to follow the right path.
I’m looking at doing Breakneck, Mohonk, or something else in the area, and my main goal is fun rock scrambling without dying.
The two mile walk just to GET to the rock scramble at Mohonk has me a little wary of Mohonk – how would you compare the two if my main goal is to climb on some rocks? 0 ↓ Tracy said: I’ve done this hike many times.. The views are breath taking. I’ve always taken the yellow down. If you take the yellow down and cross the bridge over a small creek and make a left, not far up is an old dairy barn. After exploring it for a few minutes I turn around and follow the road down you come across a cistern. The last two times I’ve passed it, it was filled with huge frogs. Continue walking and you will come to the old Cornish Estate. We were lucky enough to come across some locals who knew the history of the place and had some photos of what the house looked like before the fire. It’s a cool place to explore. To get back out to 9D you follow the red trail. 0 ↓ Bo Bell said: Great writeup, thanks! Just a note for dog owners: I live in Cold Spring and do this trail with my dog often, but she’s a Border Collie and kinda crazy athletic. She has no problem with this trail, but other dogs may. If your dog is lightweight, agile, and all over everything in the outdoors, it will probably be ok; if you have doubts, best to leave them behind. 0 ↓ Susan Haller said: The information that you provided was perfect. I can’t tell you how much my husband and I enjoyed the scramble up the first mile (with your encouragement that the rest would be easier). The Hudson River Valley is such a lovely place. Thank you. 0 ↓ Sue Edelstein said: 0 ↓ justin said: Could you tell me a way to get from breakneck to indian brook? 0 ↓ Mike said: Hey Justin, I’m afraid I don’t know of an easy way to do it.
The trailheads are about three miles apart.
If you’re up for that stroll, I suppose it’s possible, but that’s a pretty long road trek.
If anyone knows of a good cab service in Cold Spring, please illuminate us! 0 ↓ Peter said: 0 ↓ peter said: 0 ↓ Inessa said: This looks amazing!
What special skills/equipment/preparation is needed to attempt this hike?
Can a couple who hasn’t really hiked (but occasionally trailruns) complete this? We are runners and are in reasonably good shape (running 5K at least 5 times a week).
Can we do this with no special prep? 0 ↓ RicheRich said: Just good boots, you take the white trail up, easier staying to the left, nice hike on white and you can always go to the right for a more difficult climb, venture off trail for some abandoned building,s
nice Hike , we go on weekdays because it can get busy on weekends, going next monday 0 ↓ Mike said: Sounds like you’re in much better shape than me!
You should be good to go.
As RicheRich said, just good footwear, some water, snacks and a healthy sense of caution should be all you need.
If you check it out, have fun!
And if you go on one of these beautiful weekend days, enjoy all the company! 0 ↓ Jenna said: I’ve done this hike on numerous occasions & absolutely love it! I came across your website today when searching for other hikes in the area. Thanks for much for putting this all together, its awesome! 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks so much! 0 ↓ joe said: more than your average hike!
Piles of slippery leaves, dry grass, etc. careful esp. coming down.
Great vistas, bring a snack and water and chill.
9D north of tunnel near start, witnessed a dog severely stuck by a vehicle, just missed a kid.
10 min. later another crash which my daughter saw, I heard.
Very dangerous combination of cars parked along the road, traffic going too fast, people crossing the street.
Heads up! 0 ↓ Mike said: Yikes!
I hope the dog and everyone else will be okay.
Thanks for the reminder to be careful here! 0 ↓ RicheRich said: I first did this hike 15 years ago with my new Bride and puppy, more recently (past 4 years I’ve done this hike in the spring and fall, with at the time 5 year old and his 9 year old brother, last time my 11 year old daughter joined us, looking forward to going again march/April 2013, I really enjoyed your video and pictures 0 ↓ Mike said: That’s great that your kids were up to the challenge!
I hope mine will be when they’re a little older, too (they’re 10 months and 3 years right now, so they’ve got a little time yet).
Hope you have some great hikes this year, and thanks for the nice words! 0 ↓ Christopher Buck said: Hi there, Great article.
This may be a rhetorical question, but if I’m concerned about my dog, can I just take the yellow Wilkinson trail, to the red trail to the top? Thanks, Chris 0 ↓ Mike said: Chris, Thanks!
And yes, you can do that, then you could just take the White (Breakneck) Trail downhill until it gets too dicey for your pooch.
You’d still get some nice views from the top of the White Trail that way, but if you had to turn around and come back the way you came, you’d be missing out on the awesome views and clifftop perches that are farther down the White Trail (near the flagpole and immediately above it).
To me, helping a dog up a steep patch is easier than helping her down, so
I prefer to come up the White Trail.
That’s all a long way of saying — yes, your alternate plan would be perfectly pooch-safe, but you might miss out on a view or two.
Hope you and your dog enjoy the hike — should be a beautiful time of year to visit! Mike 0 ↓ Christopher Buck said: Thanks Mike,
How about taking the alternate ‘x’ trails on the White on the way up.
Does that make it anymore dog friendly? -Chris 0 ↓ Mike said: Chris, a bit more — it did save me one dog carry to try the other way at one of the Xs —
but there’s no way around hoisting the dog over certain sections.
My dog is forty pounds and it wasn’t a huge issue — but I can imagine that it could be for some dogs, especially if their owners can’t help give them a boost.
My friends’ black lab made it just fine, but that dog also needed to be hoisted in a couple of spots.
I would think most healthy dogs should probably not have too much of an issue, but it’ll definitely be a team effort in places. 0 ↓ Your email address will not be published. * * * * Recent Comments Andrey Breakneck Ridge Breakneck to Close for Repairs - http://highlandscurrent.com/2017/09/15/breakneck-close-repairs/ Sep 15, 15:28 A Surprise Lake II (via Greenwood Lake overlook) We got there before 10 am and the parking was fine.
