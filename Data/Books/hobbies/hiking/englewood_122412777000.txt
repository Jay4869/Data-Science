I was directed to park at the Fort Lee historical museum.
I did not see signs to the Long Trail from where I parked. Daniella Friedman

hiking Well maintained trails, plenty of birds and chipmunks, some deer, frogs, and turtles. A shorter walk, but it's well worth it. You wouldn't even know you're five minutes from the GWB. Overall a nice escape with a nature center and owls. Be prepared for school trips in the spring and fall. Zulia Hernández
