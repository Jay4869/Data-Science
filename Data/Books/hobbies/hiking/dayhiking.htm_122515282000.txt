Trails Around the Entrance of Denali Trails Not Near the Park Entrance The more strenuous Savage Alpine Trail runs more than four miles, and connects the Savage River area with Savage River Campground. Use the Savage River Shuttle to travel back to your starting point if you need to pick up a car, or use it to return to the park entrance if you have no vehicle; or, you can walk about two miles along the park road. The Tundra Loop is around a third of a mile through alpine country, very close to the visitor center. A spur trail leads an additional quarter of a mile, one-way, off the Tundra Loop. Trail Details An additional wrinkle is that not every trailhead is at a visitor center or road. In those cases, you might need to add a bit more time (e.g., the Meadow View Trail is only a third of a mile long, but to get to either trailhead you must hike along one of a couple different trails from the visitor center). Some of the longer trails are explained in greater detail on separate pages, linked below. A popular trail that descends to, and travels entirely around, a lake. 1 hour one-way 3.2 miles 250 feet A short, forested trail mainly used to access Horseshoe Lake from the visitor center. 45 minutes one-way 0.9 mile 75 feet Descend from the visitor center to Hines and Riley Creeks, and pass under the Alaska Railroad trestle. 1 hour one-way 1.6 miles 100 feet An increasingly steep hike out of the forest and into the alpine country. Potential views of Denali, if skies are clear. 2 hours one-way 2.7 miles 1,700 feet Travels uphill from the visitor center to the sled dog kennels and park headquarters. 1 hour one-way 1.8 miles 350 feet Travels right along the Denali Park Road, between the entrance and the visitor center. 45 minutes one-way 1.7 miles 150 feet A steep shortcut from Riley Creek Campground to the Canyon, the business district outside the park. 10 minutes one-way 0.3 mile 75 feet Paved path alongside Highway 3. 30 minutes one-way 1.0 mile 50 feet Occasionally steep trail through forest. Similar route to Roadside, but a bit longer and much quieter, as it's farther from the road. 1.5 hours one-way 2.4 miles 400 feet A very narrow trail overlooking a meadow, forming a short connection between Rock Creek and Roadside Trails. 15 minutes 0.3 mile none Denali's longest trail, with bridges over two creeks and great views of three lakes. 5 hours one-way 9.5 miles 1,000 feet A short trail through spruce forest. Good for a quick walk while waiting on a bus or train. 15 minutes one-way 0.2 mile none A short trail through spruce forest. Good for a quick walk while waiting on a bus or train. 20-minutes, total 0.2 mile none Located at Mountain Vista Rest Area, at Mile 13 of the Denali Park Road. Can be accessed by the free Savage River Shuttle and private vehicle, with ample parking available 30-minutes, total 0.6 mile total

From the Eielson Visitor Center, at Mile 66 of the Denali Park Road, this short loop explores alpine tundra. 15 minutes total 0.3 mile, total negligible From the Eielson Visitor Center, this switchback trail climbs to a ridge for high, scenic views of Denali and a vast expanse of tundra beyond. One hour, one way 0.8 mile, one way 1,000 feet From a road junction approaching Wonder Lake Campground, this trail passes through wet meadows and enters spruce forest, and ends at the McKinley River 90 minutes, one way 2.4 miles, one way negligible Accessibility The details below are meant to help you decide whether or not to travel a particular trail if you are using a wheelchair or similar assistive device. Trails not listed here are not barred to wheelchairs, but may have particularly significant natural obstacles.
Where to Start? Hiking in the Wilderness Terrain Equipment & Travel Tips Carry adequate food and water. There are no restaurants or amenities west of mile 3 on the Park Road.
Plan for bad weather. Rain is likely (and snow is possible) in summer. A hat, gloves, rain jacket and rain pants may be necessary. Other gear, such as trekking poles, calf-high gaiters and ankle-high boots will make your hike more comfortable. Be prepared to self-rescue and carry a first aid kit. Travel immediately to the Park Road and flag down a ranger or bus driver if you need assistance.
