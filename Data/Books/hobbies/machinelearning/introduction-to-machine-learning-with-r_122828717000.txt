Introduction to Machine Learning 6 hours 15 Videos 81 Exercises 52,326 Participants 6700 XP Data Science Instructor at DataCamp Vincent has a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, and has more than 3 years of experience with machine learning problems of different kinds. He experienced first-hand the difficulties that come with building and assessing machine learning systems. This made him passionate about teaching people how to do machine learning the right way. Doctoral Student at Vrije Universiteit Brussel Even though Gilles has recently graduated with a degree in Fundamental Mathematics, he knows that there's more to be done than mathematics. With a solid knowledge in classical statistics, he now pursues a PhD in parallelizing regression modeling techniques. Filip Schouwenaars Sebastian Perez Saaibi Course Description This online machine learning course is perfect for those who have a solid basis in R and statistics, but are complete beginners with machine learning. After a broad overview of the discipline's most common techniques and applications, you'll gain more insight into the assessment and training of different machine learning models. The rest of the course is dedicated to a first reconnaissance with three of the most basic machine learning tasks: classification, regression and clustering. 1

Although a traditional subject in classical statistics, you can also consider regression from a machine learning point of view. You'll learn more about the predictive capabilities and performance of regression algorithms. At the end of this chapter you'll be acquainted with simple linear regression, multi-linear regression and k-Nearest Neighbors regression.

As an unsupervised learning technique, clustering requires a different approach than the ones you have seen in the previous chapters. How can you cluster? When is a clustering any good? All these questions will be answered; you'll also learn about k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering along the way. At the end of this chapter and our machine learning video tutorials, you’ll have a basic understanding of all the main principles.
