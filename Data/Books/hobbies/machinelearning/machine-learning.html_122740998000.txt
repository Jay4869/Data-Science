Early adopters of GPU
accelerators for machine learning include many of the largest web and social
media companies, along with top tier research institutions in data science and
machine learning. With thousands of computational cores and 10-100x application
throughput compared to CPUs alone, GPUs have become the processor of choice for
processing big data for data scientists. Benchmark for Machine Learning Application "With GPUs, pre-recorded speech or multimedia content can be transcribed much more quickly. Compared to CPU implementation we are able to perform recognition up to 33x faster."
