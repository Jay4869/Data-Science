It helps people discover new content and connect with the stories they care the most about. Our applied machine learning researchers and engineers develop machine learning algorithms that rank feeds, ads and search results, and create new text understanding algorithms that keep spam and misleading content at bay. New computer vision algorithms can “read” images and videos to the blind and display over 2 billion translated stories every day, speech recognition systems automatically caption the videos that play in your news feed, and we create new magical visual experiences such as turning panorama photos into fully interactive 360 photos. — Joaquin Quinonero Candela, Director of Applied Machine Learning Our People Publications Relationship Proposal Networks Ji Zhang, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Scott Cohen, Walter Chang, Ahmed Elgammal
