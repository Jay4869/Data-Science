56,259 240,964 30 My name is Kirill Eremenko and I am super-psyched that you are reading this! Data Science Professionally, I am a Data Science management consultant with over five years of experience in finance, retail, transport and other industries. I was trained by the best analytics mentors at Deloitte Australia and today I leverage Big Data to drive business strategy, revamp customer experience and revolutionize existing operational processes. From my courses you will straight away notice how I combine my real-life experience and academic background in Physics and Mathematics to deliver professional step-by-step coaching in the space of Data Science. I am also passionate about public speaking, and regularly present on Big Data at leading Australian universities and industry events. Forex Trading Since 2007 I have been actively involved in the Forex market as a trader as well as running programming courses in MQL4. Forex trading is something I really enjoy, because the Forex market can give you financial, and more importantly - personal freedom. In my other life I am a Data Scientist - I study numbers to analyze patterns in business processes and human behaviour... Sound familiar? Yep! Coincidentally, I am a big fan of Algorithmic Trading :) EAs, Forex Robots, Indicators, Scripts, MQL4, even java programming for Forex - Love It All! Summary To sum up, I am absolutely and utterly passionate about both Data Science and Forex Trading and I am looking forward to sharing my passion and knowledge with you!

23,352 140,134 6 Hi. My name is Hadelin de Ponteves. Always eager to learn, I invested a lot of my time in learning and teaching, covering a wide range of different scientific topics.  Today I am passionate about machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence. I will do my very best to convey my passion for data science to you. I have gained diverse experience in this field. I have an engineering master's degree with a specialisation in data science. I spent one year doing research in machine learning, working on innovative and exciting projects. Then a work experience at Google where I implemented some machine learning models for business analytics.  Eventually, I realised I spent most of my time doing analysis and I gradually needed to feed my creativity so I became an entrepreneur. My courses will combine the two dimensions of analysis and creativity, allowing you to learn all the analytic skills required in data science, by applying it on creative ideas.  Looking forward to working together! Hello, je m'appelle Hadelin de Ponteves et je suis un data scientist passionné.  Etant particulièrement sensible au domaine de l'éducation, je suis déterminé à y apporter de grandes contributions. J'ai déjà investi beaucoup de mon temps dans la sphère de l'éducation, à étudier et enseigner divers sujets scientifiques.  Aujourd'hui, je suis passionné de data sciences, d'intelligence artificielle et de deep learning. Et je ferai de mon mieux pour vous transmettre mes passions. Car c'est en étant passionné que l'on réussit le mieux dans un domaine, et que l'on est le plus heureux dans notre travail au quotidien. J'ai acquis beaucoup d'expérience en data sciences. J'ai effectué mes études à l'école Centrale Paris, où j'ai suivi le parcours Data Sciences, en parallèle d'un master de recherche en machine learning à l'Ecole Normale Supérieure. Ma page étudiante s'est enchaînée avec une expérience chez Google où j'ai fait des data sciences pour résoudre des problèmes business. Puis j'ai réalisé que je passais la plupart de mon temps à analyser et je développais petit à petit un besoin de créer. Donc pour nourrir ma créativité, je suis devenu un entrepreneur. Et justement, mes cours vont tous combiner ces deux dimensions d'analyse et de créativité, grâce auxquelles vous intégrerez toutes les compétences à avoir en data sciences, en les appliquant à des idées créatives. J'ai hâte de vous retrouver dans mes cours et de partager mes passions avec vous! Hadelin de Ponteves
