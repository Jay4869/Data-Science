Best line on the market This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. A friend told me about this line and I will never use anything else. The only draw back is when I am lake fishing the line does not cut thru the water as fast as mono. But I will
sacrifice that to never loose a fish again.
My wife had some mono line on her reel and it got snagged in the weeds and snap, hook, line, sinker and bobber.
The next weekend we went back to the lake and we were fishing the same area and I pulled her whole set up out of the weeds without loosing a thing with my fireline. This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. read more Click to read full text of review titled "".
I found your site and I could breath a little better. Excellent rod and reel combo for the money This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. read more Click to read full text of review titled "Excellent rod and reel combo for the money".
have an expensive 7ft 4 inch KVD Tour Spinning Rod and T40 Carbon Reel and the Mitchell is heavier but not by much so its very light and comfortable when casting all day. I liked it so much I bought a second one. Impressive casting This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I bought this reel and rod combo about a month ago and it has replaced my favorite up to this point reel. It is noticeable the difference between my old spinning. The reel has incredible smooth and & quiet motion. The 8 ball bearings provide great casting and retraction. It was an impulse buy and I read reviews afterward which made me second guess but knock on wood this is my favorite reel & rod combo. Made me a Mitchell believer and customer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Have not used it yet....sorry This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. read more Click to read full text of review titled "Have not used it yet....sorry".
products off the shelf!!!!
Hope someone there could understand how much money could be transferred having meetings there. Great little reel. This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Bought this reel a few weeks ago and put it on a 3' ice fishing rod for my daughter who is 2 1/2. Very pleased with this reel, casts smooth, light weight and easy to use. She loves it. Great rod for a woman This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. My wife like the action and strong back bone. And the feeling of the rod. Can't beat it This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Bought this rod for my girlfriend for Christmas but couldn't wait. We took it striper fishing just to see how it did. First fish broke off using 12lb line. But was happy to see her haul in a 6lb striper yesterday. I am very impressed with the this rod and ugly stik as a whole. Will be buying there striper combos for bigger striper soon. This reel works Great in Rain and Wind too! This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I love my Ardent Pro bait casting reel. These reels have worked great for me in all conditions, wet, windy, sunny and dry and hot! They have not let me down, while others are picking at theirs, I am casting away. Awesome reel This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I personally like this reel, It is smooth in operation and can cast a long distance. Once you have it dialed in backlashing is minimal. This frog is awesome This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. These frogs are good, they walk across the water easily and before you know it a fish is hitting your lure. The first day i bought the lure my first cast I hit a bass. Definitely catches fish! This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I've used several frogs before but used the pad crusher for the first time yesterday and boy, was I impressed. A lot cheaper compared to other brands and did everything right. Caught a nice fatty on my 3rd cast and then some. Great for the price Great Lure! This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I bought this lure a month ago and I always keep it in my tackle bag. i've caught five 2+ pound bass in a day using this bait on the flats. i recommend this bait. Great Quality Jig and Sharpest Hook This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Used these and few other styles of the Strike King TroKar jigs and could not be happier. Great quality and components. And the TroKar hook is seriously the sharpest hook on the planet. i just love it color everything This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I saw this at another place it lasted about a week and this one is brand new so I will buy it They work This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I was skeptical at first but I bought a pack of D-Bombs to see what all the fuss was about. After throwing a jig, beavers, and Pit Bosses on my last scouting trip I decided to try these baits. All I can say is they eat um. Often. I'm a firm believe in the D-Bombs now. Not to mention they smell so good I want to eat them myself. My only complaint is that they need to make one in a "blue saphire" color. Other than that, I 100% recommend these baits to anyone who wants to catch more fish. My go to bait This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. This is my favorite go to bait. I use a 1/8 weighted hook with a screw lock and texas rig it. It has been working for me all the time. Whenever other baits are not working for me I always go to a D-Bomb. My Go To This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I bought these the other day and first cast I had a nice hook up. The action of the tail is the best I've used. Great imitation and colors are amazing. great versatile bait This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Great weight and buoyancy for skipping under trees and dock... also works in heavy cover or open water, the action of this bait is amazing and almost effortless Berst Hook On Market This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Most Versatile Well Built Hook I Have Ever Used. Strong, Perfectly Waited And did I say "SHARP" Don't hesitate This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Have been happy with Costa for years but after trying these, I'll never go back. Just wait til you see the water bead off the Carl Zeiss lenses! Great product, durrable This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Bought this to put on my Toyota truck bed rail system to hold my rods instead of laying them in the bed. This way I could carry 12 rods and reels and still have the bed of the truck for other cargo. I mounted 4 of them on to the bed rail system with stainless steal bots, nuts and washers without having to drill a single hole. Works great and looks cool Great option to Texas rigging This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. These are awesome for anything plastic. The swivel allows movement in current that I believe makes a difference. Very easy to use. A little pricey though. Shad Pole This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Haven't had a chance to use yet but judging by the videos and the reviews is going to be awesome can't wait THE go-to lure! This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I almost always start my fishing trips using the shad pole lures. They work excellent for everything from crappie, walleye, bass, and catfish. If I haven't caught anything in the first half hour with this lure then the fish are probably not gonna be biting at all. The lure size and rotating tail make them irresistible to hungry fish. Good Float This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I bought this at the beginning of summer and have fished it hard. It casts very well and is noisy with a good slurp/gulp sound when the float dips under water. Also, the small beads make a clack when worked lightly. The paint has started coming off, but that doesn't affect the fish. I like this one more than the outcast as the leader attaches to the bottom, not the same eyelet as the line...makes for less tangles.
It's tough to see at night, that's my only complaint. Great corks This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Have caught alot of fish on these corks hands down best action.. This gloves are the best I've ever used! This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I purchased these glove a few weeks ago. They have been very useful at work and keep my hands protected. These glove last longer than most gloves do. I always repurchase. They are the best. I've recommend these gloves to my friends at work now I see these purple glove on all my gal pals at work. Awesome gloves This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. My wife loves these gloves and she used them for gardening. They are great for the price Cach 5lbs+ bass!!! This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. My dad went to a turn a minute and he brought home a bunch of striking Lewers I solve the recon worms and I used a Texas rig and I casted out on my first gas and caught a 5 pound bass this is a great Bait I think everyone should buy it. Best 'big worms' on the market This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. The action created by the Rage Tail is fantastic! These worms are great for large bass, but not too big for smaller 1 & 2 pounders either.
