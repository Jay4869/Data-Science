Fishing Fishing is allowed on City-owned reservoirs, lakes and streams as designated by specific DEP signs and according to all applicable New York State regulations. Most City-owned reservoirs offer excellent fishing opportunities for both warm-water species such as smallmouth and largemouth bass, as well as cold-water species such as trout. City-owned reservoirs are open for fishing from shore and with fishing boats, and it is common for many reservoirs to produce 4-5 pound bass and lake trout exceeding 15 pounds! In addition to its reservoirs, DEP also offers City-owned watershed lands that border excellent trout fishing streams such as the Batavia Kill, West Branch Delaware River, Esopus Creek, and many smaller tributaries.
