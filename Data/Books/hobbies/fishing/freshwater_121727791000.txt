Florida's freshwater fisheries comprise 3 million acres of lakes, ponds and reservoirs, and approximately 12,000 miles of fishable rivers, streams and canals-with no closed seasons. The recreational fishery resources alone in these waters provide entertainment for more than 1.2 million anglers annually, who enjoyed 25.7 million days fishing recreationally in Florida's fresh waters (National Survey of Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife Associated Recreation-2011).     This section of FWC's website is home to recreational and commercial freshwater fishing regulations, providing fishing tips and specific information on fishery sites and forecasts to get you started fishing and exploring new areas.
