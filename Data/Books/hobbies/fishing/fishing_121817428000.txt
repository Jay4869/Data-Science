A saltwater license is required south of U. S. Highway 90 and a freshwater or saltwater license is valid between I-10 and U. S. Highway 90. Saltwater license is not valid north of I-10. Any person sixty-five (65) or older, or any person otherwise exempted from obtaining a freshwater fishing license, must have documentation with him/her at all times while fishing as described in Exemptions. [MS. Code 49-7-9] Effective July 1, 2010, residents 65 years of age or older are required to purchase a lifetime recreational saltwater fishing license ($7.29, includes all fees). All non-resident anglers, except minors under the age of sixteen (16), are required to obtain a fishing license while fishing in the fresh or marine waters of the State of Mississippi. Exemptions Residents who are visually impaired, paraplegic, a multiple-amputee, adjudged totally disabled by the Social Security Administration or totally service connected disabled by the Veterans Administration are not required to purchase a HUNTING OR FISHING LICENSE. [MS. Code 49-7-5 and 49-7-9] Residents exempt based on this criteria are required to have proof of their age, residency, disability status or other physical impairment in their possession while engaged in hunting and fishing activities. All exempt licenses previously issued for DISABILITIES are null and void. Proof of Residency principal or primary home or place of abode You are entitled to purchase a resident hunting license if Mississippi is your principal or primary home or place of abode. A current Mississippi resident income tax return or a home stead exemption receipt may be considered as evidence of domicile, but these are not necessarily determinative. You may be denied a resident hunting license if you fail to provide adequate proof. Even if you are domiciled in another state, you may purchase a resident hunting license if you provide either (1) a current identification card from a Mississippi college or university; or (2) a current military ID card showing that you are an active member of the Armed Forces (excluding Reserves and the National Guard) and proof that you are stationed on a military base in Mississippi.
