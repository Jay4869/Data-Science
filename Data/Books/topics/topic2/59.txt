Offered By Medical Neuroscience explores the functional organization and neurophysiology of the human central nervous system while providing a neurobiological framework for understanding human behavior In this course you will discover the organization of the neural systems in the brain and spinal cord that mediate sensation motivate bodily action and integrate sensorimotor signals with memory emotion and related faculties of cognition The overall goal of this course is to provide the foundation for understanding the impairments of sensation action and cognition that accompany injury disease or dysfunction in the central nervous system The course will build upon knowledge acquired through prior studies of cell and molecular biology general physiology and human anatomy as we focus primarily on the central nervous system This online course is designed to include all of the core concepts in neurophysiology and clinical neuroanatomy that would be presented in most first year neuroscience courses in schools of medicine However there are some topics e g biological psychiatry and several learning experiences e g hands on brain dissection that we provide in the corresponding course offered in the Duke University School of Medicine on campus that we are not attempting to reproduce in Medical Neuroscience online Nevertheless our aim is to faithfully present in scope and rigor a medical school caliber course experience This course comprises six units of content organized into  weeks with an additional week for a comprehensive final exam Unit  Neuroanatomy weeks   This unit covers the surface anatomy of the human brain its internal structure and the overall organization of sensory and motor systems in the brainstem and spinal cord Unit  Neural signaling weeks   This unit addresses the fundamental mechanisms of neuronal excitability signal generation and propagation synaptic transmission post synaptic mechanisms of signal integration and neural plasticity Unit  Sensory systems weeks   Here you will learn the overall organization and function of the sensory systems that contribute to our sense of self relative to the world around us somatic sensory systems proprioception vision audition and balance senses Unit  Motor systems weeks   In this unit we will examine the organization and function of the brain and spinal mechanisms that govern bodily movement Unit  Brain Development week  Next we turn our attention to the neurobiological mechanisms for building the nervous system in embryonic development and in early postnatal life we will also consider how the brain changes across the lifespan Unit  Cognition weeks   The course concludes with a survey of the association systems of the cerebral hemispheres with an emphasis on cortical networks that integrate perception memory and emotion in organizing behavior and planning for the future we will also consider brain systems for maintaining homeostasis and regulating brain state p Let s get started in Medical Neuroscience Each module in Medical Neuroscience will begin with a brief description like this that provides you with an overview of the module In this first module you will get to know something about Prof White and his career in neuroscience you will understand the scope of Medical Neuroscience its learning resources your responsibilities for maximizing your benefit in this course and you will learn Prof White s tips on how best to study and learn p p At the end of this module please take the ungraded preliminary quiz Are you ready for Medical Neuroscience to self assess your background knowledge Your score on this quiz will not count toward your overall score in this course However you should be able to pass this quiz score  or better if you are ready for the academic challenge of this course Students who are likely to achieve their goals in Medical Neuroscience should be able to successfully answer nearly all of the quiz questions on their first attempt and feel comfortable with assessment questions at this level of knowledge p Your introduction to Medical Neuroscience continues as you experience in this module a brief introduction to the human brain its component cells and some basic anatomical conventions for finding your way around the human central nervous system We now begin in earnest our lessons on neuroanatomy with the surface of the human brain including a brief run through the cranial nerves and the blood supply to the CNS In this module you will learn the basic subdivisions of the vertebrate nervous system however your focus should be on the cerebral cortex Along the way you will be challenged to build a digital brain that should help you generate and improve your mental â modelâ of the cerebral hemispheres of the human brain Another great way to refine your mental model is through sketching and crafting so please do the learning objectives that are designed to help you make visible and tangible your understanding of the cerebral hemispheres We now turn our attention from the tangible human neuroanatomy to the physiological as we explore the means by which neurons generate propagate and communicate electrical signals After exploring those structures in the human brain that are visible to the unaided eye we must now sharpen our focus and zoom in as it were to the unitary level of organization and function in the central nervous system to the level of individual neurons and their component parts that are crucial for neural signaling Letâ s continue our studies of neural signaling by learning about what happens at synaptic junctions where the terminal ending of one neuron meets a complementary process of another excitable cell We have reached a significant juncture in Medical Neuroscience as we turn our attention to the organization and function of the sensory systems We will begin our studies with the somatic sensory systems which includes subsystems for mechanical sensation and pain temperature sensation But before we get there it is worth considering first some organizing principles that will set the stage for studies of somatic sensation and all the other sensory systems of the body This module will provide lessons that are designed to help you understand the basic mechanisms by which light is transduced into electrical signals that are then used to construct visual perceptions in the brain Your studies of the visual system will benefit you at this point in the course but also in later studies when we use the visual system as a model for understanding general principles of developmental plasticity Lastly it is worth noting how much of the forebrain contains elements of the visual pathways Thus injuries and disease in widespread regions of the brain may have a clinically important impact on visual function All the more reason to learn these lessons well as you progress in Medical Neuroscience Our survey of the sensory systems continues as we now turn our attention to the auditory system the vestibular system and the chemical sensory systems As you study this content notice the similarities and the differences that pertain to the general mechanisms of sensory transduction and the broad organization of the central pathways in each of these sensory systems In particular note the similarity in transduction mechanisms for audition and vestibular sensation and note the â logicâ of sensory coding in the chemical sensory systems We come now to another pivot in Medical Neuroscience where our focus shifts from sensation to action Or to borrow a phrase made famous by C S Sherrington more than a century ago the title of his classic text we will now consider the â integrative action of the nervous systemâ We will do so in this module by learning the basic mechanisms by which neural circuits in the brain and spinal cord motivate bodily movement At this juncture in our exploration of motor control letâ s focus on one of the best studied paradigms for understanding the neural control of movement the eye movement system Next we will consider two major brain systems that modulate the output of upper motor neuronal circuits the basal ganglia and the cerebellum Take note the output of these systems is NOT directed at lower motor circuits directly rather their output engages the motor thalamus and brainstem upper motor neuronal circuits Thus the actions of the basal ganglia and cerebellum are to modulate rather than command the activities of upper motor neurons As you study the lessons in this module appreciate how the basal ganglia and cerebellum function in a somewhat complementary fashion to modulate the initiation and coordination of movement respectively We conclude our survey of movement and motor control by considering the visceral motor system perhaps better known as the autonomic nervous system As you study this lesson consider how the disparate physiology of the viscera has impact not only on the internal state of the body but also on implicit processing in the forebrain We will return to this matter when we consider the neurobiology of emotions near the conclusion of Medical Neuroscience This module represents another turning point in Medical Neuroscience Now that we have surveyed human neuroanatomy and our sensory and motor systems we are ready to take a step back and consider how this magnificent central nervous system came to be the way that it is We will also learn how the brain re wires itself across the lifespan as genetic specification experience dependent plasticity and self organization continue to interact re shaping the structure and function of neural circuits throughout the central nervous system It may surprise you to know that in all of our studies of the neural systems for sensation and action we have yet to properly account for the organization and function of roughly  of the entire cerebral mantle Thus only  of the cerebral cortex is accounted for by the modal sensory and motor cortical areas The majority of the human cerebral cortex is multi modal cortex that associates signals derived from one or more modal systems We now turn our attention to this â associational cortexâ as we consider more complex aspects of brain function In this concluding module of Medical Neuroscience we will consider the neurobiology of sleep and the neurobiology of emotion including addiction Both topics involve explorations of complex widely distributed systems in the forebrain and brainstem that modulate states of body and brain This module contains materials that will help you prepare for the final challenge in Medical Neuroscience our clinical case based Comprehensive Final Exam Please allow me a few more moments of your time to express my thanks for all your
