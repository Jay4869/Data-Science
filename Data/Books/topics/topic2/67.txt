There s a saying among certain Silicon Valley billionaires that nobody cares about privacy My inbox suggests quite the opposite In recent months my email Twitter feed and Washington Post Help Desk have been deluged with your questions and concerns about the secret life of our data You ve shared your outrage at how smart TVs and credit cards web browsers and iPhone apps treat our lives like a product to be sold You ve asked me great questions about how you can identify and stop unwanted surveillance Some of you have even taken the reporting into your own hands diving into dense privacy policies and data feeds to report to me what you find You ve inspired my investigations and columns for months to come Ask our tech columnist a question This feels like the beginning of a movement So I wanted to share a few recent queries that show how we can demand more transparency from the technology in our lives It s our data after all It s not as private as you might hope despite a federal law known as HIPAA short for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act A reader from Silver Spring Md who asked me not to use her name emailed me after reading the privacy policy in an external website used by her doctors at George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates The patient portal FollowMyHealth com reserves rights to use personal health record data for marketing and advertising purposes including sending you marketing and advertising communications whether on our behalf or on behalf of marketing partners Say what Nobody wants to see their medical diagnosis turn into an ad The eagle eyed reader also noted that when she logged in to Follow My Health she couldn t find any privacy or data sharing controls The only way to prevent the use of my data for marketing appears to be canceling deleting my account she wrote What s the law here A patient portal that has a business associate agreement with your doctor s office to collect your personal health information should be covered by HIPAA said Deven McGraw the former deputy director of health information privacy at the Office for Civil Rights in the U S Department of Health and Human Services And under HIPAA showing paid targeted advertisements should require consent from each patient When I contacted Follow My Health s corporate parent Allscripts it painted a narrower picture of its practices and claimed the site wasn t limited by HIPAA Tom Lynch the company s director of marketing communications said the site is not disclosing identifiable patient data to third parties for any marketing purpose even though its privacy policy specifically reserves the right to release personal health data for marketing and advertising That policy was updated in August Lynch said Follow My Health is using information about patients to alert them to certain goods and services that could support their ability to make more informed choices about their own care All of that happens inside the Follow My Health website We have discussed the possibility of alerting patients to information about medical research opportunities clinical trials or insurance plans that could be relevant he said But here s the head scratcher Follow My Health claims it is not limited by HIPAA Unlike a patient portal that a vendor hosts or supports for a single health care provider a vendor of a personal health record product that allows individual consumers to aggregate their health information from multiple sources is not regulated by HIPAA Lynch said The HIPAA covered business associate relationship he said is limited to the technical work that is necessary to establish and maintain connectivity between a doctor s electronic records system and Follow My Health GW Medical didn t respond to my questions about its business relationship with Follow My Health This case speaks to a broader problem with HIPAA said Sharon A Anolik president of the consulting firm Privacy Panacea There s a misconception that all health information is protected by HIPAA it s just not true she says A growing number of apps and websites skirt oversight such as wearable devices that track your heart rate or an app or portal where individuals can store their own health information If a company isn t covered by HIPAA it can do more with your health information than you might think without your consent she said The takeaway Yes you should be suspicious of health portals even if your doctor uses them And we should demand doctors be more careful about who they do business with The Post reader who alerted me to Follow My Health may have ushered along an improvement Lynch said that by the end of the year the site will give account holders the ability to opt out from marketing Apple Pay is convenient but does it protect my privacy asked Jack Miller from Arlington Mass The short answer is it does not hide you from retailers and point of sale systems that track purchases Using Apple Pay does create a special new version of your credit card number which is good for security You won t have to run out and get a new credit card if a merchant gets hacked and a criminal tries making a purchase with that stolen number But Apple Pay doesn t change your card number each time you make a purchase in a store So a retailer could still use your Apple Pay number as a way to identify you and track you across visits That s why for example Square terminals at coffee shops and food trucks are still able to text receipts to your previously submitted phone number A few months ago I wrote about a Web experiment where I used software to tally up all the tracking cookies I received in a week of normal browsing It was an astounding   Several readers asked me how they could track the trackers too Now there s an easy way to repeat my experiment for yourself You just have to be using the Mozilla Firefox browser which I recommend anyway over Google s Chrome for its superior default privacy settings Starting with Version  of Firefox released Tuesday there s a weekly status report tallying the times the browser s enhanced tracking protection has blocked third party cookies and social media trackers You ll find it under show report when you tap the shield icon next to the Web address I ve been running a beta version of the new Firefox software for the past week and tallied   trackers Now if only it would also name and shame the sites guilty of doing the most tracking Read more from our Secret Life of Your Data series Alexa has been eavesdropping on you this whole time It s the middle of the night Do you know
