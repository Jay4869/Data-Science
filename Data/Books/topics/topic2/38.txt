Intended for healthcare professionals Vegetarian diets and health Objective To examine the associations of vegetarianism with risks of ischaemic heart disease and stroke Design Prospective cohort study Setting The EPIC Oxford study a cohort in the United Kingdom with a large proportion of non meat eaters recruited across the country between  and  Participants   participants with no history of ischaemic heart disease stroke or angina or cardiovascular disease were classified into three distinct diet groups meat eaters participants who consumed meat regardless of whether they consumed fish dairy or eggs n   fish eaters consumed fish but no meat n  and vegetarians including vegans n   based on dietary information collected at baseline and subsequently around  n   Main outcome measures Incident cases of ischaemic heart disease and stroke including ischaemic and haemorrhagic types identified through record linkage until  Results Over   years of follow up  cases of ischaemic heart disease and  cases of total stroke  ischaemic stroke and  haemorrhagic stroke were recorded After adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle confounders fish eaters and vegetarians had  hazard ratio    confidence interval   to   and      to   lower rates of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters respectively P   for heterogeneity This difference was equivalent to  fewer cases of ischaemic heart disease  confidence interval   to   fewer in vegetarians than in meat eaters per  population over  years The associations for ischaemic heart disease were partly attenuated after adjustment for self reported high blood cholesterol high blood pressure diabetes and body mass index hazard ratio    confidence interval   to   in vegetarians with all adjustments By contrast vegetarians had  higher rates of total stroke hazard ratio    confidence interval   to   than meat eaters equivalent to three more cases of total stroke  confidence interval   to   more per  population over  years mostly due to a higher rate of haemorrhagic stroke The associations for stroke did not attenuate after further adjustment of disease risk factors Conclusions In this prospective cohort in the UK fish eaters and vegetarians had lower rates of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters although vegetarians had higher rates of haemorrhagic and total stroke Vegetarian and vegan diets have become increasingly popular in recent years partly due to perceived health benefits as well as concerns about the environment and animal welfare  In the United Kingdom both the representative National Diet and Nutrition Survey   and a  Ipsos MORI survey estimated about   million vegetarians and vegans living in the country  Evidence suggests that vegetarians might have different disease risks compared with non vegetarians  but data from large scale prospective studies are limited because few studies have recruited sufficient numbers of vegetarian participants For ischaemic heart disease some but not all previous studies reported significantly lower risks of mortality from ischaemic heart disease in vegetarians than in non vegetarians  In terms of incidence the only previous study the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer EPIC Oxford reported that vegetarians had a lower risk of ischaemic heart disease than non vegetarians  but at the time of publication the study had an insufficient duration of follow up to separately examine the risks in other diet groups fish eaters and vegans For stroke two previous reports  including one that included EPIC Oxford data  found no significant differences in risk of total stroke deaths between vegetarians and non vegetarians However no previous studies have examined the incidence of stroke in relation to vegetarian diets or have examined the main stroke types We report here the risks of both incident ischaemic heart disease and stroke in people with distinct dietary habits that is meat eaters fish eaters and vegetarians including vegans with a separate evaluation of ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes over  years of follow up in the EPIC Oxford study EPIC Oxford is a prospective cohort study of about   men and women who were recruited across the UK between  and  Details of the recruitment process have been described previously  Individuals were recruited from either general practices or by postal questionnaire The general practice recruitment method recruited  men and women aged  to  who were registered with participating general practices all of whom completed a full questionnaire on their diet lifestyle health characteristics and medical history The postal recruitment preferentially targeted vegetarians vegans and other people interested in diet and health and recruited   participants aged  or older A full questionnaire was mailed to all members of the Vegetarian Society and all surviving participants of the Oxford Vegetarian Study  and respondents were invited to provide names and addresses of relatives and friends who were also interested in receiving a questionnaire A short questionnaire was also distributed to all members of the Vegan Society enclosed in vegetarian and health food magazines and displayed in health food shops and a full questionnaire was subsequently mailed to all those who returned the short questionnaire Despite the targeted recruitment of the postal method about  of meat eaters in the cohort were recruited by post Subsequently a follow up questionnaire was sent to participants in  which asked similar questions on their diet and lifestyle and participants returned the questionnaires between  and  A participant flowchart of the recruitment process and inclusion into this study is shown as supplementary figure  The study protocol was approved by a multicentre research ethics committee Scotland A Research Ethics Committee and all participants provided written informed consent The full baseline questionnaire collected responses to four questions about consumption of meat fish dairy products and eggs in the form of Do you eat any meat including bacon ham poultry game meat pies sausages or similar for the other three food groups These four questions were used to classify participants into meat eaters participants who reported eating meat regardless of whether they ate fish dairy or eggs fish eaters participants who did not eat meat but did eat fish vegetarians participants who did not eat meat or fish but did eat one or both of dairy products and eggs and vegans participants who did not eat meat fish dairy products or eggs The follow up questionnaire sent in  included identical questions on consumption of meat fish dairy products and eggs yes no Therefore at both baseline and follow up participants were classified into one of four diet groups meat eaters fish eaters vegetarians and vegans Owing to the small number of vegans vegetarians and vegans were combined as one diet group in the main analyses but the two groups were examined separately for each outcome in secondary analyses The baseline questionnaire also included a semiquantitative food frequency section containing  items which asked about dietary intake over the past year and which was previously validated using  days in four sets of four days of weighed dietary records and selected recovery and concentration biomarkers  For calculation of food and nutrient intakes the frequency of consumption of each food or beverage was multiplied by a standard portion size mostly based on data from the UK Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food  and nutrient content of each food or beverage based on McCance and Widdowson s food composition tables  Because our prespecified analysis plan was to examine disease risks associated with distinct dietary groups the associations of individual foods and nutrients with risks were not assessed in this study but information on intakes of foods and nutrients were used in descriptive and secondary analyses In addition to diet the baseline questionnaire also asked questions on sociodemographic characteristics lifestyle and medical history including questions on education level smoking physical activity use of dietary supplements and use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy in women Socioeconomic status was categorised by use of the Townsend deprivation index  based on the participants postcodes For physical activity based on their responses to questions asked about their occupation and their time spent participating in activities including walking cycling and other physical exercises participants were categorised by a validated physical activity index with four levels  Alcohol consumption was determined from responses to five items on the food frequency questionnaire Questions relating to smoking and alcohol consumption were also asked on the follow up questionnaire in  For biological measurements body mass index was calculated from participants self reported height and weight at recruitment which was previously found to be accurate compared with measured height and weight in a validation study of about  participants  All participants were also asked at recruitment whether they were willing to have their blood pressure measured at their general practice and to provide a blood sample Details of the procedures for blood pressure measurement and blood sample collection which were conducted in subsets of the cohort have been previously reported  Participants were followed up via record linkage to records from the UK s health service up to  March  Outcomes of interest were ischaemic heart disease codes   from ICD  international classification of diseases  revision or codes   from ICD  including acute myocardial infarction ICD   or ICD   and total stroke ICD       or ICD      including ischaemic stroke ICD    or ICD   and haemorrhagic stroke ICD    or ICD    Details of events using the relevant ICD  or ICD  codes were obtained from hospital records or death certificates Participants who were not resident in England Wales or Scotland n  were excluded as were those with no Hospital Episode Statistics data or NHS number n  We also excluded participants who completed the short questionnaire only n  were younger than  n  or older than  at recruitment n  had no follow up were censored at or before the date of recruitment eg if they were living abroad n  could not be traced by the NHS n  had an unknown diet group if they did not answer the relevant questions to be classified n  had unreliable nutrient data  of food

vegetarians including vegans and each outcome of interest with meat eaters as the reference group For participants who completed both the baseline and follow up questionnaire diet group and relevant time varying covariates smoking and alcohol consumption were updated at follow up The underlying time variable was the age at recruitment to the age at diagnosis death or administrative censoring whichever occurred first For acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease events were censored on the respective outcomes of interest For total stroke ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke events were censored on any stroke All analyses were stratified by sex method of recruitment general practice or postal and region seven regions across the UK and adjusted for year of

the basis of Schoenfeld residuals and was not violated for the variables of interest in the adjusted model for either ischaemic heart disease or stroke P   for all categories Self reported history of high blood pressure no yes unknown high blood cholesterol no yes unknown diabetes no yes unknown and body mass index             unknown were assessed as potential physiological mediators since these factors were known to be associated with vegetarian diets  as well as being established cardiovascular risk factors  Total fruit and vegetable intake total dietary fibre and total energy intake each continuous were assessed as possible relevant dietary factors We assessed the effects of potential physiological mediators and possible relevant dietary factors by adding each variable one at a time to the previous model An additional model was also fitted including all potential physiological mediators To estimate the population impact of vegetarian diets on cardiovascular health we assessed the absolute risk difference for each outcome between meat eaters fish eaters and vegetarians Predicted incidence and absolute risk differences were presented as per  population over  years and were estimated by use of hazard ratios and  confidence intervals expressed as floating absolute risks  which do not alter the value of the hazard ratios but assign an appropriate  confidence interval to all groups including the reference group thereby allowing an estimation of the uncertainty in the effect size in the reference group In meat eaters predicted incidence over this time period of each outcome was calculated as  Sr  where Sr  observed incidence in meat eaters  and represents the predicted  year survival that is non incidence in meat eaters By subtracting this estimate of survival from  and multiplying by  the resulting estimate represents incidence per  population over  years For all other diet groups predicted incidence was calculated as  SrHR  where HR represents the hazard ratio or confidence intervals for each outcome in that diet group By applying HR or confidence interval estimates in each diet group as an exponential to survival in the reference group SrHR represents the predicted  year survival rate in the each of the other diet groups Absolute risk differences were then calculated as the crude differences between the predicted incidence per  population over  years between each diet group and the meat eaters Additional sensitivity analyses included analyses using baseline diet group only excluding participants with less than five years of follow up including participants recruited via the postal method only censoring at age  or setting entry time at age  to evaluate possible differences by age at event and performing multiple imputation with  imputations for missing covariates The percentages of missing values in the covariates were   for the Townsend deprivation index   for physical activity   for education level and less than  for each of the other covariates We assessed heterogeneity in the associations between diet group and risk of ischaemic heart disease or stroke by sex age at recruitment  or  years smoking

for any illness or condition no yes by adding appropriate interaction terms to the Cox models and testing for statistical significance of interaction across strata using likelihood ratio tests All analyses were performed with Stata version   or   Stata Corp TX United States and P values less than   were considered significant No members of the community or patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment design or implementation of the study They were not asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results We are appreciative of our participants who although not partners were engaged in the progress of EPIC Oxford through follow up questionnaires The results are disseminated to study participants through newsletters and the study website www epic oxford org The analyses included   participants of whom   had reported on diet both at baseline and at follow up on average  years later Of these participants with repeated measures of diet    of   meat eaters at baseline remained meat eaters at follow up Of fish eaters and vegetarians at baseline   of  and   of  were in the same diet

educated less likely to smoke reported slightly lower alcohol consumption were more physically active and were more likely to report dietary supplement use They were also less likely to report previous high blood pressure high blood cholesterol or diabetes or receive long term treatment for illnesses In women non meat eaters were more likely to report oral contraceptive use but less likely to report use of hormone replacement therapy Non meat eaters reported having lower body mass index and had lower measured blood pressure than meat eaters For blood lipids vegetarians had about   mmol

concentrations Baseline characteristics of participants in different diet groups in the EPIC Oxford study n   Food and nutrient intakes in the different diet groups are presented in table  and

vegetarians and vegans separately the point estimates for vegans were lower for ischaemic heart disease     to   and higher for total stroke     to   than meat eaters but neither estimate was statistically significant possibly because of the small number of cases in vegans as indicated by the wide confidence intervals supplementary table  Rates of ischaemic heart disease and stroke in fish

heterogeneity in risk between diet groups based on Wald tests Box sizes are proportional to the number of cases in each group When the roles of potential mediators of the associations were assessed the associations between diet group and ischaemic heart disease were marginally attenuated when adjusted for self reported history of high blood pressure high blood cholesterol and diabetes and for self reported body mass index The lower rate of ischaemic heart disease in vegetarians was of borderline significance when adjusted for all potential mediators simultaneously     to   supplementary table  For stroke adjustments for potential mediators caused small changes in the hazard ratios the association became slightly stronger for vegetarians after adjustment for self reported history of high blood pressure and to a lesser extent when adjusted for history of diabetes or for body mass index Additional adjustment for fruit and vegetable intake total fibre or total energy had little effect on the results Table  shows the absolute risks of ischaemic heart disease and total stroke in the three diet groups By comparing the absolute risk difference of each outcome by diet group for

present study examines the risks of both ischaemic heart disease and stroke including subtypes in meat eaters fish eaters vegetarians and vegans in a cohort with a large proportion of non meat eaters We observed lower rates of ischaemic heart disease in fish eaters and vegetarians than in meat eaters which appears to be at least partly due to lower body mass index and lower rates of high blood pressure high blood cholesterol diabetes associated with these diets Conversely vegetarians had higher risks of haemorrhagic and total stroke In a collaborative meta analysis of five previous prospective studies Adventist Mortality Study Health Food Shoppers Study Adventist Health Study Heidelberg Study Oxford Vegetarian Study with median recruitment between  and  vegetarians had a  lower rate ratio of death from ischaemic heart disease    confidence interval   to   than non vegetarians  In other analyses of death from ischaemic heart disease the death rate ratios comparing vegetarians with non vegetarians were     to   in a combined analysis of EPIC Oxford and the Oxford Vegetarian Study      to   in the German Vegetarian Study  and     to   in the Adventist Health Study   In a recent meta analysis that pooled the estimates from these previous prospective studies including a previous report from the EPIC Oxford study that only compared vegetarians with non vegetarians meat and fish eaters combined  the risk ratio for ischaemic heart disease comparing vegetarians with non vegetarians was     to    For stroke previous analyses including one study that included EPIC Oxford data but with fewer cases than the present study  reported no significant differences in stroke mortality by diet group  and pooled analyses showed a similar result  However previous studies only reported on stroke mortality  which might be strongly influenced by treatment as well as the underlying disease risk  and no studies were found which reported on the two subtypes of stroke The results of the present study showed that fish eaters and vegetarians had lower risks of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters The associations were attenuated after adjustment for self reported high blood pressure high blood cholesterol diabetes and body mass index which suggests that part of the associations might be attributed to these factors However the lower risk in vegetarians and vegans remained marginally significant after adjustment for all of these factors The reason for such differences is not certain but could be partly attributed to lower concentrations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL C or non HDL C concentrations as a surrogate associated with meat free diets  differences that were not fully accounted for by adjusting for self reported high blood cholesterol Previous meta analyses of prospective studies showed that lower concentrations of non HDL C or LDL C were associated with lower risks of ischaemic heart disease  Furthermore both randomised trials of statin  and mendelian randomisation  have confirmed a causal association of LDL C with ischaemic heart disease Hence fish eaters and vegetarians who have lower non HDL C table  or LDL C than meat eaters  could have lower risks of ischaemic heart disease However the possible beneficial roles of generally healthier diets that included high intakes of fruit and vegetables  legumes  or  cannot be excluded despite little change in the hazard ratios after adjustment for these individual components For stroke outcomes the combined results from two randomised statin trials reported  higher risks of haemorrhagic stroke per  mmol L reduction in LDL C  which are consistent with results of observational studies of cholesterol concentrations and haemorrhagic stroke  A recent study that included observational and genetic evidence from China alongside the trial evidence from western countries has suggested this inverse association between LDL C and haemorrhagic stroke might be causal  These previous studies corroborate the findings of the present study indicating that vegetarians who have relatively low LDL C had higher risks of haemorrhagic stroke For ischaemic stroke previous prospective studies and randomised trials have consistently shown weak positive associations of non HDL C or LDL C levels with risk  which is supported by recent mendelian randomisation studies  This apparent discordance between previous evidence and those of the present study for LDL C levels and ischaemic stroke suggests that other dietary factors associated with the lack of animal food consumption could contribute to the observed associations Results of several studies in Japan showing that individuals with a very low intake of animal products had an increased incidence and mortality from haemorrhagic and total stroke and also a possibly higher risk of ischaemic stroke mortality  suggest that some factors associated with animal food consumption might be protective for stroke Vegetarians and vegans in the EPIC Oxford cohort have lower circulating levels of several nutrients eg vitamin   vitamin D  essential amino acids  and long chain n  polyunsaturated fatty  and differences in some of these nutritional factors could contribute to the observed associations  Serum concentrations of these nutritional factors and non HDL C have only been measured in a subset of the EPIC Oxford cohort and therefore their role in the observed associations of vegetarian diets with ischaemic heart disease or stroke cannot be accurately determined in the current context but should be further investigated High blood pressure is an established major risk factor for both ischaemic heart disease and stroke  and recent evidence confirmed this is true for all age groups especially for haemorrhagic stroke  However given that the vegetarians in the EPIC Oxford study had lower blood pressure than the meat eaters and the fact that the association between diet group and stroke risk became slightly stronger after adjustment for history of high blood pressure this factor is unlikely to account for the higher risks of haemorrhagic and total stroke observed among vegetarians in the present study Furthermore although differential treatment of cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension in the different diet groups could influence their subsequent disease risk this does not appear to be the case in the EPIC Oxford study previous analyses in this cohort have shown that although vegetarians had lower use of drug treatment overall than non vegetarians no significant differences were seen in the use of specific treatments for high blood pressure high blood cholesterol or diabetes by diet group among those individuals who reported a diagnosis of these conditions  Misclassification of stroke cases such as the misclassification of haemorrhagic stroke as ischaemic stroke cannot be excluded as a possible explanation for the possibly discrepant results for ischaemic stroke although previous adjudication studies of stroke types confirmed the reliability of hospital admission records and death certificates in the UK for diagnosis of stroke types in the UK population over this calendar period  Although age is also an important risk factor for both ischaemic heart disease and stroke and meat eaters in the present study were on average  years older than the vegetarians age is known accurately in our cohort and therefore any potential confounding or cohort effect is accounted for by the analyses that use age as the underlying time variable and further adjust for calendar year of entry The current study focused on the examination of risks associated with predefined dietary groups and therefore the relative contributions of individual foods have not been assessed Future research could benefit from dose response analyses of foods that distinguish the diet groups including meat fish dairy and eggs to identify possible optimal levels of consumption for balancing risks from different outcomes Such analyses might be better performed in other large scale cohorts with greater numbers of people who consume these foods or pooled analyses from multiple cohorts with varying levels of consumption Methods such as diet optimisation modelling or linear  could also be explored to identify optimal diets for disease prevention while respecting individual dietary choices The strengths of this study include a large sample size a long follow up and outcome ascertainment by linkage to medical records that minimised the loss to follow up Because the exposure of interest was distinct diet groups defined by the exclusion of animal foods the chance of misclassification of exposure was relatively low Long term adherence to diet groups in the cohort was also generally high and where possible we updated the exposure and important confounders at  year follow up to allow for any changes The analyses also included adjustment for multiple confounders assessment of several possible mediators and sensitivity analyses to confirm the robustness of the results Among the limitations of the present study diet group was self reported and reasons for choosing each diet were not recorded Changes in diet group or other behaviours not captured by the follow up were also possible and the composition of vegetarian diets could have changed during follow up owing to increasing availability of vegetarian foods but differences in nutrient intakes between the diet groups were similar at baseline and at follow up  Reverse causality is possible but not likely because the results were similar after we excluded the first five years of follow up and most participants had followed their current diet eg vegetarian for more than five years at the time of recruitment Information on drug treatment use including statins at recruitment was not available As with all observational studies residual confounding from either dietary or non dietary factors is possible which might be particularly relevant if results were of borderline significance Generalisability could be limited because the present study was based predominantly on white European individuals Overall the present study has shown that UK adults who were fish eaters or vegetarians had lower risks of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters but that vegetarians had higher risks of stroke Future work should include further measurements of circulating levels of cholesterol subfractions vitamin  amino acids and fatty acids in the cohort to identify which factors might mediate the observed associations Additional studies in other large scale cohorts with a high proportion of non meat eaters are needed to confirm the generalisability of these results and assess their relevance for clinical practice and public health Vegetarian and vegan diets have become increasingly popular in recent years but the potential benefits and hazards of these diets are not fully understood Previous studies of two diet groups have reported that vegetarians have lower risks of ischaemic heart disease than non vegetarians However no evidence has been reported of a difference in the risk of mortality from stroke possibly because of limited available data and lack of available evidence on stroke subtypes This study showed that fish eaters and vegetarians including vegans had lower risks of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters Vegetarians including vegans had higher risks of haemorrhagic and total stroke than meat eaters Further research is needed to replicate these results in other populations and to identify mediators that might contribute to the observed associations We thank all participants in the EPIC Oxford cohort for their invaluable contribution
