OmniVision is the new holder of the Guinness World Record for the smallest commercially available image sensor The tiny device pictured above in a camera module next to a grain of pepper measures just half a millimetre squared and will have a significant impact on the medical imaging landscape Traditionally procedures in the body s smallest anatomy such as neuro ENT cardiac spinal and gynaecology procedures were performed blind or with low quality images from fiberscopes because existing cameras were too big and reusable endoscopes were not cost effective OmniVision s tiny image sensor used in conjunction with its   x   camera module addresses these issues As OmniVision s marketing director Aaron Chiang explains the technology offers a compact high quality solution for disposable guidewires catheters and endoscopes which are experiencing growing demand because of their ability to reduce cross contamination risks downtime inefficiencies and costs associated with the repairs preprocedural testing and sterilization of reusable endoscopes The sensor is also the only ultra small chip on tip camera with backside illumination which provides excellent image quality and better low light performance to help reduce LED heat along with improved sensitivity Not only does that stand to improve cost effectiveness for hospitals but it s good news for patients too says Chiang who notes that the compact disposable device can improve patient comfort and shorten recovery time
