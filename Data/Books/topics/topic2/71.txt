claims about the therapeutic benefits of their products The federal agencies accused Rooted Apothecary of unlawfully asserting that their cannabidiol products could treat symptoms of conditions such as ADHD Parkinson s disease ear aches ADHD and autism Those claims appeared on the company s website and social media accounts they said Certain products appeared to be marketed as dietary supplements which FDA currently prohibits as it works to develop an alternative regulatory scheme for CBD Cannabis and cannabis derived compounds are subject to the same laws and requirements as FDA regulated products that contain any other substance Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless said in a press release We are working to protect Americans from companies marketing products with unsubstantiated

protecting and promoting public health through sound science based decision making remains our top priority FTC s complaint with the company is that it violated a law that requires businesses that advertise medical claims about their products to have competent and reliable scientific evidence to back them up which could include human clinical trials Making or exaggerating such claims through a

it s taking to resolve the issues If the company fails to do so it is subject to legal action including the possible seizure of its products or an injunction It may also have to compensate customers FDA emphasized that CBD products other than the prescription medication Epidiolex for the treatment of intractable epilepsy are not currently allowed But it also reiterated that the agency is in the process of developing rules that could allow for the lawful marketing of the compound In April FDA sent warning letters to three other CBD companies that it said was making unauthorized claims about the medical benefits of their products FTC also submitted warning letters to three separate CBD companies for allegedly advertising misleading statements about their products last month These letters are examples of the agency s use of enforcement discretion Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb who recently suggested that the federal government should be involved in regulating state marijuana programs clarified in March that the agency is only going after companies that make especially misleading claims about their products Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R KY who championed a provision of the  Farm Bill federally legalizing hemp and its derivatives has urged FDA to clear a path for the lawful marketing of CBD products by using enforcement discretion while it develops an interim final rule A bipartisan group of lawmakers made a similar request in a letter sent to the agency last month The FDA is working quickly to further clarify our regulatory approach for products containing cannabis and cannabis derived compounds like CBD while using all available resources to monitor the marketplace and protect public health by taking action as needed against companies FDA

To Combat Cartel Violence Hemp Regulations Will Be Issued Within Weeks Top USDA Official Says Published By California Gov Gavin Newsom D announced on Saturday that he signed several marijuana related bills into law including one that will let legal businesses take advantage of more tax deductions but also vetoed another measure that would have allowed some patients to use medical cannabis in health care facilities Under a section of current federal law known as  marijuana growers processors and sellers are unable to deduct expenses from their taxes that businesses in any other sector would be able to write off Until now California policy simply mirrored the federal approach But under AB  the state tax code will depart from Internal Revenue Service policy when it comes to  allowing licensed state cannabis firms to take deductions just like other business Newsom who campaigned for the state s successful marijuana legalization measure that voters approved in  also signed SB  which allows businesses to provide free medical cannabis to low income patients and exempts those products from state taxes Gov GavinNewsom signed  our legislation to ensure cannabis compassion programs which provide free medical cannabis to low income patients can survive These programs are critical to the health of many with HIV cancer PTSD other conditions Thank you Governor Scott Wiener Scott_Wiener October   Another bill signed by the governor SB  directs state officials to develop and submit to the U S Department of Agriculture an industrial hemp program plan in accordance with the provisions of the  Farm Bill which federally legalized the crop and its derivatives including CBD The California hemp industry looks to become a significant force nationally thanks to the bill Eric Steenstra president of Vote Hemp said in a press release But Newsom begrudgingly vetoed legislation SB  that would have required certain health care facilities to allow terminally ill patients to use medical cannabis on site This bill would create significant conflicts between federal and state laws that cannot be taken lightly the governor wrote in a veto message that suggested facilities would be at risk of losing Medicare and Medicaid funds if they allowed use of federally illegal cannabis It is inconceivable that the federal government continues to regard cannabis as having no medicinal value Newsom said adding that its ludicrous stance puts patients and those who care for them in an unconscionable position California NORML Director Dale Gieringer said in an email that the group is disappointed with the governor s veto noting that the legislation had already been watered down from an initial version that covered more than just terminal patients The bill even allowed exemptions in the case that federal agencies ruled or notified the facilities that they were violating the law he said Other legislation Newsom signed includes measures on marijuana testing laboratories vape

Published By A former GOP congressman with a long track record of opposing marijuana legalization efforts is now cashing in on the legal cannabis industry FSD Pharma a Canadian company that is a licensed producer of pharmaceutical grade cannabis through its subsidiary FV Pharma and researches cannabinoid based therapies announced on Friday that former Rep Steve Buyer R IN joined its board of directors Missing from the press release is mention of his legislative history that includes repeated actions to oppose federal protections for state level marijuana reforms From  to  Buyer cosponsored two resolutions and one bill aimed at condemning legalization and upholding federal prohibition His opposition extended to limited medical cannabis reforms too voting five times from  to  against an amendment to protect state laws and the patients and providers complying with them from federal prosecution One of the anti marijuana resolutions he signed onto passed the House but did not advance in the Senate As introduced it characterized cannabis as both dangerous and addictive and stated that Congress is unequivocally opposed to legalizing marijuana for medicinal use and urges the defeat of State initiatives that would seek to legalize marijuana for medicinal use The version that passed which Buyer voted for expressed concerns that ambiguous cultural messages about marijuana use are contributing to a growing acceptance of marijuana use among children and teenagers and noting that federal authorities can enforce prohibition through seizure and other civil action as well as through criminal penalties The separate bill he cosponsored sought to declare state laws that allow cannabis use as null and void I t is the intent of the Congress to supersede any and all laws of the States and units of local government insofar as they may now or hereafter effectively permit or purport to authorize the use growing manufacture distribution or importation by an individual or group of marijuana or any controlled substance which differs from the provisions of the Controlled Substances Act and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act or regulations issued pursuant thereto it read It s not quite clear what changed for Buyer but his appointment to the board of a major marijuana company that has benefitted from the successful reform movement he opposed is sure to raise questions In response to Marijuana Moment s query about what accounted for the former congressman s evolution on the issue FSD Pharma President Zeeshan Saeed simply replied  options as all other Directors and  cash comp Hours later Saeed clarified that he intended to send that reply to another journalist Raza Bokhari executive co chairman and CEO of FSD Pharma said in a subsequent email that he s known Buyer for years and believes that while he remains opposed to recreational use of cannabis he has come to recognize the potential of cannabinoid molecule in drug development targeting auto immune diseases especially the role of synthetic cannabinoids and other cannabinoids targeting the endocannibinoid system of the human body The former congressman has been on a very personal journey with his wife being plagued with an auto immune disease that has no cure and others in her family also that suffer from auto immune diseases Bokhari said He added that Buyer has personally invested a quarter of a million dollars in the company and compared him to former House Speaker John Boehner R OH who also joined the marijuana industry after opposing cannabis reform while serving in Congress In a press release announcing the appointment Buyer said the opportunity to participate in FSD s growth at this stage is exciting and that he s attracted by FSD s medical research to tame and define the unknown by challenging the edges of medical science to provide relief to people suffering from fibromyalgia and other serious illnesses In welcoming Steve Buyer to the FSD Pharma Board of Directors and announcing a share consolidation the Company has made an immense positive stride forward https t co  FSD Pharma FsdPharma October   One industry that the former congressman s actions did assist while in office and later went on to work for as a lobbyist is Big Tobacco Buyer raised eyebrows in  when he opposed legislation to regulate the tobacco industry and argued in a House floor speech that a person is just as likely to experience the health consequences of cigarettes if they were to smoke dried lettuce or grass He insisted that it s smoke that kills not the nicotine Shortly after retiring Buyer joined tobacco company Reynolds American as a lobbyist and paid consultant There have been several reports that noted Buyer s decision not to run for reelection in  came amid controversy over a foundation he founded The Frontier Foundation was supposed to provide educational funding for students but while it raked in tens of thousands from pharmaceutical interests such as Ely Lilly and PhRMA over a three year period it reportedly hadn t distributed a single scholarship His retirement came months after USA Today and the Indianapolis Star reported on the foundation s activities But now Buyer is entering the cannabis space and the company described his experience in the pharmaceutical industry and Congress as an asset In welcoming Steve Buyer to the FSD Pharma Board of Directors and announcing a share consolidation the Company has made an immense positive stride forward FSD Pharma CEO Raza Bokhari said Steve s addition has further strengthened the independence and profile of the FSD Pharma Board of Directors his broad leadership experience and pharmaceutical industry relationships will help enhance our visibility especially among U S Institutional investors and on U S Capitol Hill Buyer also previously served as a special assistant U S attorney and an Indiana deputy attorney general This story has been updated to include

could be coming to a dispensary near you An application for a patent on the cannabis container concept was published by the U S Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday In order to comply with state regulations while at the same time ensuring consumers know what they re buying the inventors are pitching a secure package that uses non THC volatiles to produce the scent of the product when a sticker on the exterior is scratched The applicants recognized in their filing that there s an existing patent application for scratch and sniff stickers that are meant to identify the flavor of coffee but argued their idea is distinct because the other application produced the scent of coffee after it s brewed whereas this sticker would smell like cannabis in its unsmoked form A major hurdle to the purchase of Cannabis is the secure packaging laws of various states the application states Packaging can often prevent a purchaser from observing certain characteristics of the Cannabis such as its scent In a summary of the proposal the applicants said the general purpose of the present invention is to provide a Cannabis package and method of selection that includes all the advantages of the secure packaging and overcomes the drawbacks inherent therein Random Vaughn and Jonathan Tanzer via USPTO Another advantage of the proposed packaging is to help patients identify medicinal properties of different marijuana varieties or assess quality without having to open the product the applicants Random Vaughn and Jonathan Tanzer of Olympia Washington argued They said that scent is is important in selecting Cannabis for medical reasons such as seizures headaches or insomnia The application lists two iterations of the concept The main one would involve a sticker that would be infused with the scent of cannabis Terpenes which are non intoxicating compounds in the plant that give cannabis its smell and taste would be used to produce the scent For the other the scent wouldn t correspond with the actual small of the marijuana itself but instead various flavor notes which are sometimes used in cannabis marketing to describe the product s qualities similar to what s often done with wine The applicants listed a diverse list of potential smells including freshly cut grass bread vanilla bacon fish and chips a Christmas tree cinnamon after shave shampoo the seaside furniture polish and a
