The gov means it s official Federal government websites often end in gov or mil Before sharing sensitive information make sure you re on a federal government site The site is secure The https ensures that you are connecting to the official website and that any information you provide is encrypted and transmitted securely The widespread adoption and use of software technologies is opening new and innovative ways to improve health and health care delivery Software functions that meet the definition of a device may be deployed on mobile platforms other general purpose computing platforms or in the function or control of a hardware device The FDA s policies are independent of the platform on which they might run are function specific and apply across platforms The term software functions includes mobile applications apps Mobile apps can help people manage their own health and wellness promote healthy living and gain access to useful information when and where they need it These tools are being adopted almost as quickly as they can be developed According to industry estimates in    health care applications were available on smartphones which equates to an expected   billion mobile health application downloads that year by smartphone users worldwide Users include health care professionals consumers and patients The FDA encourages the development of mobile medical apps MMAs that improve health care and provide consumers and health care professionals with valuable health information The FDA also has a public health responsibility to oversee the safety and effectiveness of medical devices including mobile medical apps The Policy for Device Software Functions and Mobile Medical Applications Guidance first issued in  as Mobile Medical Applications MMA guidance and updated in  and  explains the agency s oversight of device software functions including mobile medical apps as devices and our focus only on the software that presents a greater risk to patients if it doesn t work as intended and on software that causes smartphones computers or other mobile platforms to impact the functionality or performance of traditional medical devices In  the FDA updated the guidance to reflect changes to the device definition in accordance with Section  of the  Century Cures Act which created a function specific definition for device The functions excluded from the device definition are independent of the platform on which they might run Also the FDA clarified that the policies for software are function specific and apply across platforms Therefore instances of mobile application in the guidance and on this webpage have been changed to software function Accordingly the FDA updated the title of the guidance to Policy for Device Software Functions and Mobile Medical Applications On this page Mobile apps are software programs that run on smartphones and other mobile communication devices They can also be accessories that attach to a smartphone or other mobile communication devices or a combination of accessories and software Mobile medical apps are medical devices that are mobile apps meet the definition of a medical device and are an accessory to a regulated medical device or transform a mobile platform into a regulated medical device Consumers can use both mobile medical apps and mobile apps to manage their own health and wellness such as to monitor their caloric intake for healthy weight maintenance For example the National Institutes of Health s LactMed app provides nursing mothers with information about the effects of medicines on breast milk and nursing infants Other apps aim to help health care professionals improve and facilitate patient care The Radiation Emergency Medical Management REMM app gives health care providers guidance on diagnosing and treating radiation injuries Some mobile medical apps can diagnose cancer or heart rhythm abnormalities or function as the central command for a glucose meter used by an insulin dependent diabetic patient The FDA applies the same risk based approach to device software functions as the agency uses to assure safety and effectiveness for other medical devices This guidance document provides examples of how the FDA might regulate certain moderate risk Class II and high risk Class III device software functions The guidance also provides examples of software functions that We encourage software developers to email the FDA as early as possible if they have any questions about their software its level of risk and whether a premarket application is required The FDA is taking a tailored risk based approach that focuses on the subset of software functions that meet the regulatory definition of device Software functions span a wide range of health functions While some software carries minimal risk those that can pose a greater risk to patients will require FDA review For more information please see examples of premarket submissions of MMAs that are cleared or approved by the FDA and examples of device software functions the FDA regulates for a detailed list of examples of software that are medical devices and would require FDA review For a list of what is considered a device software function manufacturers and developers can search the FDA s public database of existing classification by type of software for example diagnostic Approved cleared device software functions will also be listed in the FDA s  k and PMA databases and on the FDA s Registration Listing Database The FDA s device software functions and mobile medical apps policy does not require software developers to seek FDA re evaluation for minor iterative product changes For many software functions that meet the regulatory definition of a device but pose minimal risk to patients and consumers the FDA will exercise enforcement discretion and will not expect manufacturers to submit premarket review applications or to register and list their software with the FDA This includes device software functions that For a more detailed list of examples of these types of device software functions that are not the focus of FDA s oversight please see examples of software functions for which the FDA will exercise enforcement discretion The FDA s mobile medical apps policy does not regulate the sale or general consumer use of smartphones or tablets The FDA s mobile medical apps policy does not consider entities that exclusively distribute mobile apps such as the owners and operators of the iTunes App Store or the Google Play Store to be medical device manufacturers The FDA s mobile medical apps policy does not consider mobile platform manufacturers to be medical device manufacturers just because their mobile platform could be used to run a mobile medical app regulated by the FDA    Sign up to receive email updates on Digital Health
