Perspective Interpretation of the news based on evidence including data as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events Houston and Washington are battling in the World Series But the cities can battle about weather too Here s why D C s weather is terrible according to Eric Berger and Matt Lanza who run Houston s outstanding weather website Space City Weather For Capital Weather Gang s perspective on why Houston s weather is awful written by Jason Samenow see Hey Houston Your weather is horrible and Washington s got you beat Look we understand that Houston resides within the tropics with sultry summer days and nights And our proximity to the Gulf of Mexico leaves the region vulnerable to hurricanes But whereas Houston has steamy summers we have delightful winters down here By contrast the year round weather in Washington much like the Nationals bullpen sort of stinks Let s start with your summers June might seem like a nice month if you like  mph winds baseball size hail and hellstorms that rage across  miles like the  derecho Then there is the heat High temperatures in July and August often soar well into the  up your way And while this isn t quite Houston hot the humidity is not far behind But don t take our word for it the Capital Weather Gang recently characterized summers in the District as unbearable punishing and oppressive We must respectfully agree Incidentally this is also how the Nationals will characterize the Astros pitching staff in a few days One of the most memorable hurricanes to strike the nation s capital came in  when Hurricane Hazel brought wind gusts of  mph to the region Remarkably as the storm approached Washington the center accelerated to  mph We can empathize Our first inclination in approaching the nation s capital is also to move as fast as possible minimizing our exposure to hot air Your region also faces the threat of storm surge as a  hurricane demonstrated by pushing water levels  feet above tide levels along the Potomac D C s biggest hurricane threats tend to come in September and October so good luck with summer and even early fall in the capital Begin with derechos enjoy punishing heat in the middle and finish with a tropical threat Bless your hearts By the time October rolls around in Houston we re generally beginning to enjoy extended stretches of  and  degree days with periodic bouts of low humidity and cool nights We can wear sweaters if we want to but most days we don t have to This is not the case for Washington of course Where to begin There was the Snowpocalypse of December  when  inches of snow fell Less than three months later Snowmageddon dropped another  inches on the district Then just a few days later came Snoverkill Y all got some weird storm names by the way And you can t even measure snow properly I mean come on At the same time the District seems incapable of handling snow A few years ago a single solitary inch of the white stuff brought the region to a standstill And when it s not snowing in Washington you complain about it not snowing to the point that there was even a hashtag For some morning laughs comedy here s what one model the NAM predicts for the weekend snow event It is an outlier and we don t think it s right but it is amusing Most other models predict  or  inches for DC We ll have our updated forecast midday DCsnowhole pic twitter com  Lololol DCing DCSnowhole pic twitter com  You ve also got this thing called a wedge where cold air can get trapped when it s supposed to warm up The only wedges we have in Houston are the lime wedges in our margaritas And to top it off besides snow one can also find a mix of sleet freezing rain or just plain cold rain pelting down from the sky during the winter months No gracias We re sure Washington has its charms when it comes to meteorology We ve heard the cherry blossoms are nice when it s not storming in springtime But the problem with spring in Washington next year is it will mean spring training And next year that will entail painful memories of José Altuve Gerrit Cole and the boys putting the Nationals in their place
