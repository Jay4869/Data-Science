the discussion USA TODAY Sports Paul Myerberg breaks down the latest Amway Coaches Poll USA TODAY Though the going rate for college football coaches seems to reset every few years the sport changed forever on Dec   when Texas A M agreed to pay Jimbo Fisher  million over  years It wasn t just the size of the salary or length of the deal that made it an outlier It was the fact that Texas A M was willing to commit such massive money to a coach who was not exactly a slam dunk to make the Aggies a national championship level program Yes Fisher had won a title at Florida State in  with arguably one of the best college football teams of all time But winning a championship at Florida State where it has been done before is not the same as doing it at Texas A M where they ve finished a season in the top  just six times since  Plus Fisher s program at Florida State had been somewhat on the decline for three straight years exposing his offensive rigidity and refusal to embrace analytics on things like fourth down conversions Though it s still extremely early in Fisher s tenure his   overall record at Texas A M hasn t exactly made the traditional SEC powers nervous But because every dollar of his contract is guaranteed that s   million at the end of this regular season he s under no administrative pressure for the foreseeable future No matter what happens Texas A M and Fisher are stuck with each other for at least the next handful of years Maybe that will be a good thing if Fisher starts beating Alabama and LSU regularly and contending for the SEC championship But for now that contract makes Fisher look massively overpaid He s not the only one though Given the constant churn of the coaching carousel the short supply of proven winners out there to hire and the pressure on administrators to keep successful coaches plenty of schools are getting taken to the cleaners in contract negotiations these days Here are the eight worst contracts this year in college football Jimbo Fisher is in his second season as head coach at Texas A M after leading Florida State for eight years Photo Joshua S Kelly USA TODAY Sports Total  compensation   million Contract end date Dec   Buyout   million Why the school paid so much Since joining the SEC in  Texas A M s answer to every problem has been to throw money at it So when it was time to jettison Kevin Sumlin who earned a hefty   million buyout himself with no offset provision if he took a new job the Aggies were going to do whatever it took to get a coach with national champion on his résumé And clearly it took a lot For Texas A M though just being able to pull Fisher away from a blueblood program in Florida State was an achievement in and of itself for a school that enjoys genuflecting in its financial strength as much as it does winning on the field Why it s a bad contract Massively overrated to start this season Texas A M will finish   if its remaining games go as expected That means Fisher s first two years won t be much different record wise than Sumlin s final two Though recruiting has gone well for Fisher there s a legitimate question about whether his best days as an offensive innovator quarterback guru are behind him When you look at the evolution of programs like Alabama and LSU Fisher s pro style system looks like a relic and relies heavily on a complicated playbook that not all quarterbacks can handle As we saw late in his tenure at Florida State and early this season Fisher s offense falls apart without a great offensive line If Fisher can t evolve the way other top programs have Texas A M will be paying an above market rate mostly for the national championship he won with another school CRUNCHING NUMBERS  surprising numbers from college football coaches salaries report OPINION  worst deals among college football coaches contracts BIG BUYOUT Does Gus Malzahn s massive buyout at Auburn make him untouchable Coach Dana Holgorsen had a   record in eight seasons at West Virginian before moving to Houston this season Photo Maria Lysaker USA TODAY Sports Total  compensation   million Contract end date Dec   Buyout   million Why the school paid so much Few institutions in all of college sports have a higher hubris to accomplishment ratio than Houston The Cougars think they belong in a Power Five league and the way to get there is dominating the American Athletic Conference no matter how unrealistic that might be So when the school dumped Major Applewhite after just two seasons the Cougars and megabooster Tilman Fertitta were determined to spend big on a splashy hire and what better way to grab headlines than pulling a coach away from a Power Five school Though Holgorsen wanted out of West Virginia badly landing a  year  million contract in a city he likes living in is a pretty nice soft landing Why it s a bad contract It seems highly unlikely Holgorsen will ever take the Cougars where they want to go Though Houston has good recruiting geography and attractive facilities it s not going to consistently recruit like a Power Five team unless or until it s in a Power Five league That means it s going to be hard to create a real talent gap with the rest of the AAC which has a number of strong programs including UCF Memphis Temple and Navy Holgorsen is a good coach with a solid track record but he s never finished a season higher than ranked No  And for all the talk about Houston s potential it s only won two conference titles in the past  years That doesn t sound like a combination primed to live up to a contract that busted the market for Group of Five teams Willie Taggart had head coaching stops at Western Kentucky South Florida and Oregon before moving to Florida State in  Photo Glenn Beil USA TODAY Sports Total  compensation  million Contract end date Jan   Buyout   million Why the school paid so much When Fisher left for Texas A M Taggart seemed like the obvious choice to replace him Taggart had turned around two smaller programs at Western Kentucky and South Florida and particularly in Tampa had shown a strong ability to recruit in the talent rich I  corridor The problem was that Taggart already had a good job at Oregon and no matter how badly he wanted to return to his home state he wasn t going to leave after one year without getting a significant raise With Oregon reportedly offering around  million a year to stay Florida State had no choice but to pony up Why it s a bad contract The Taggart era has been a major disappointment and this already looks like a situation where the school would consider moving on if not for the massive buyout he s owed Though many of the early problems can be traced to roster erosion in Fisher s final years the Seminoles missed a bowl game last season for the first time since  and have looked unprepared and poorly coached on several occasions Though wins over Louisville and N C State recently seemed like a step forward Florida State got humiliated by Clemson   on Oct  showing how big the gap remains Taggart also hasn t exactly set the world on fire in recruiting which seemed like a given when he got the job Before becoming coach at Michigan Jim Harbaugh had a four year stint at Stanford where he went   including   in  Photo Kim Klement USA TODAY Sports Total  compensation   million Contract end date Jan   Buyout   million Why the school paid so much It s hard to remember now but most people outside of Michigan were skeptical that Harbaugh would even be willing to return to college football in  given how successful he d been in the NFL That s why a desperate Michigan couldn t mess around and go cheap In order to make a real run at Harbaugh there was no choice but to offer a landmark contract Now however that deal has just two seasons remaining on it which is almost unheard of in big time college sports It will be interesting to see if either side seriously engages on an extension and what that might look like given the underwhelming results so far Why it s a bad contract Though Harbaugh has been far from a disaster there was no ambiguity about the expectations when he took the job And those expectations have not been met The reason you pay a coach   million a year is to contend for national titles win conference titles and beat your biggest rivals Five years in Harbaugh hasn t done any of that although he came awful close in  Had one spot of a football changed by two inches against Ohio State that year Harbaugh might have won the Big Ten and been in the College Football Playoff But without those signature wins it s hard to justify the contract Kirby Smart went   in his second season at Georgia losing in the College Football Playoff finale Photo Dale Zanine USA TODAY Sports Total  compensation   million Contract end date Dec   Buyout   million Why the school paid so much Smart s contract has changed significantly in a relatively short period of time When he was initially hired as a first time head coach Smart s deal with Georgia averaged around   million per year which was slightly less than his predecessor Mark Richt was making But after Smart s second season when he led Georgia to the SEC championship and within a whisker of winning the College Football Playoff the school locked him up to a seven year  million deal That essentially brings him in line contractually with Auburn s Gus Malzahn who has also won an SEC title and made a national championship game Why it s a bad contract The largesse of Smart s deal is tied almost exclusively to the market rate established by his peers not the demand for him specifically In other words if Georgia had told Smart that it would pay him  million a year with a  million buyout take it or leave it would there be another college program or NFL team willing to pay him more or offer him a better situation Probably not Smart is a Georgia guy who is uniquely positioned at his alma mater to capitalize on an in state talent base that s good enough to win the national title And yet if he doesn t deliver that in the next few years remember Richt s record through his first  seasons was just as good as Smart s this will look like a big overpay Kirk Ferentz has a   record in  plus seasons at Iowa Photo Reese Strickland USA TODAY Sports Total  compensation   million Contract end date Jan   Buyout   million Why the school paid so much It s not written into state law that Ferentz will get a new contract every few years that extends out another decade but it sure seems that way This is Ferentz s  season at Iowa and he s signed for six more which means he d be  when this current deal expires Ferentz got his first big deal early in his tenure after three straight top  finishes as Iowa had to fight off significant interest from the NFL They gave him a  year extension after the Hawkeyes went   in  with a trip to the Orange Bowl And then after  when Iowa went   in the regular season and nearly beat Michigan State for the Big Ten title and a Playoff spot he got another  year deal that essentially locks him in for the rest of his career Why it s a bad contract Just on principle a  year contract for an older coach who is not competing at an elite level on a regular basis is a bad idea Though Ferentz has certainly had some great moments at Iowa it has basically been a middle of the pack Big Ten program for the last decade with an occasional pop of national relevance That s OK for now but if there ever comes a point where it looks like Ferentz is slipping his contract may make it prohibitive to wind down his tenure amicably Chad Morris went   in three seasons at SMU before taking over at Arkansas Photo Nelson Chenault USA TODAY Sports Total  compensation  million Contract end date Dec   Buyout   million Why the school paid so much Arkansas was in a tough spot after firing Bret Bielema in  After Gus Malzahn rebuffed a big money offer to stay at Auburn Arkansas was pretty far down the list of desirable jobs in a year with a lot of coaching changes Not only did that limit Arkansas pool of candidates but it created leverage for someone like Morris who was making a little more than  million a year at SMU and didn t necessarily need to take on a major rebuilding job in the SEC unless he was going to get a huge bump in pay Why it s a bad contract Plucking a successful coach from a Group of Five program is always a bit of a gamble for a Power Five school because you just don t know if it will translate But in Morris case he hadn t even been particularly successful at SMU with a   overall record Though in fairness the team had improved each year going   in his final season there Morris reputation was largely formed due to his work as Clemson s offensive coordinator So far though it s been a debacle at Arkansas as he s   in the SEC   overall has yet to beat a Power Five team and has lost to the likes of North Texas Colorado State and San Jose State A link has been posted to your Facebook feed
