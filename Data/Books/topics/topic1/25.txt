Every spring millions of American high school kids are faced with this choice It sounds like a no brainer And it used to be a no brainer because college used to cost a reasonable amount of money As recently as  you could get a four year bachelor s degree at a public school for less than   on average These days it ll cost you at least   or upward of   for a private school or well over   for a top school Unless a kid has rich parents or a full ride scholarship he must borrow a ton of money to pay for the privilege of attending college Education Costs and Student Debt Are Skyrocketing A few weeks ago I wrote about how America s broken healthcare industry was bankrupting families Well the cost of college has jumped WAY more than the cost healthcare The cost of a four year degree has shot up  in the past  years as you can see here RiskHedge If car prices jumped as much as tuition a base model Toyota Corolla would cost   today As costs have zoomed higher kids are burying themselves under bigger and bigger piles of debt Student loan balances have snowballed over  in the past  years Last month they hit   trillion RiskHedge If student debt were a stock every Wall Street analyst would be screaming bubble And get this Americans now owe more for student debt than they owe for credit cards and auto loans combined In fact the average kid takes out   in debt a  jump in  years That s a deep hole to dig out of before you re legally allowed to drink beer And student loans are the only type of debt you can t escape no matter what Declaring bankruptcy can wipe away your mortgage your credit card debt and even stop IRS wage garnishments But it won t take a penny off your student loans Turn  and haven t paid off your student loans They ll raid your Social Security check each month What Do Healthcare and College Have in Common The government s dirty fingerprints are all over both As you may know the Federal government practically owns the student loan market More than  of all student loans come directly from the US government And the small  slice that doesn t come from the government is still fully guaranteed by the government If you ve applied for a mortgage lately you know it s a painful process You fill out stacks of paperwork pay steep fees and hand over a full accounting of your family s finances But thanks to Uncle Sam trillions of dollars in student loans get handed out to  year old kids like candy on Halloween This free money has warped the whole system and pushed college costs far beyond all reason Think about it this way When banks were handing out no money down mortgages in the early  to anyone with a pulse what happened to house prices They SOARED Well colleges know Uncle Sam is bankrolling students so they hike fees year after year A recent New York Fed study found for every new dollar of federal student aid colleges hike tuition by  cents College Is America s Most Undisruptable Industry I wish I could tell you the whole college system is about to get sledgehammered by disruption But unfortunately college has been America s most undisruptible industry unlike other industries I recently covered The vast majority of high school grads still go to college Once hailed as potential disruptors for profit colleges haven t made a dent You ve probably seen commercials for The University of Phoenix It grew rapidly into one of the biggest and most famous for profit colleges in the US But enrollment has plunged lately And the stock of its parent company Apollo Education Group APOL crashed  Other for profit educators like Corinthian Colleges and Indiana s ITT Tech went bankrupt a few years back and their stocks were de listed Despite the crazy cost college is still worth it for many folks today If you want to be a professional like an architect a lawyer or a CPA you pretty much have to go to college On the other hand if you plan to study archaeology or interpretive dance college is almost definitely not worth it There Are Promising Signs That College Is Changing Have you heard of Coursera It s a website where students can enroll in courses from many of the world s top colleges like Stanford Yale and Princeton Want to learn how financial markets work from an Ivy League school like Yale You can enroll for just  bucks month In the past few years over  million Americans took an online course I ve taken classes on public speaking from online learning platform Udemy They cost ten bucks each and were excellent The world s fourth largest company Google GOOG now offers professional certificates on Coursera You can get a cloud computing certificate in two months Google has given financial aid to   students taking the course Here s My Prediction for How the Disruption Will Play Out It s only a matter of time before Coursera and other online disruptors start offering real college degree courses What happens when you can get a bona fide online college degree one that confers the exact same benefits of an in person college degree for a couple of thousand dollars The number of kids going to traditional college will crater And schools will be forced to slash their tuition costs Many top American colleges are already making this shift You can get a degree from Ivy League school University of Pennsylvania over the internet now The best part Online tuition costs roughly half what you d pay versus sitting in a lecture hall even though the course material is identical Look we re barely in the first inning of disrupting education Who knows maybe in a few years the likes of Google and Amazon will open up their own colleges You ll get trained by Google for free And when you finish Google will charge companies to recruit you We Must Always Ask What Will the World Look like in Five Years Early signs are mounting that some traditional colleges are in trouble After rising every decade since  the number of US colleges has fallen over the past  years And the number of kids going to college has declined for seven consecutive years Top schools like Yale Harvard and Stanford will always attract elite kids and command huge tuitions But online disruptors could put many of the   middle of the road US
